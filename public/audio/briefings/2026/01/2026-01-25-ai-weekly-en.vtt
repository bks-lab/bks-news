— Kristalina Georgieva, IMF Managing Director

13
00:01:16,025 --> 00:01:21,662

14
00:01:21,662 --> 00:01:27,900
Entry-level positions that traditionally provided career starts for young workers would be eliminated first .

15
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:39,187
The IMF chief described unregulated, market-driven AI deployment as her "biggest worry," adding: "Even in the best prepared countries, I don't think we are prepared enough" .

21
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:10,712
"I'm a little bit surprised they've moved so early into that.

22

Ads, there's nothing wrong with ads...

23
00:02:13,012 --> 00:02:17,987
But in the realm of assistants, there is a question about how ads fit into that model.

24
00:02:17,987 --> 00:02:20,012
You want to have trust in your assistant."

32
00:02:53,687 --> 00:03:01,437
