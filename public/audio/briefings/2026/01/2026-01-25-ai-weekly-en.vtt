00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:00,962
TL;DR.

2
00:00:00,962 --> 00:00:03,087
This week in 30 seconds:.

3
00:00:03,087 --> 00:00:10,300
Apple + Google: Historic billion-dollar deal brings Gemini to Siri - the biggest AI partnership of the year.

4
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:18,887
Disney + OpenAI: Mickey Mouse, Elsa and Darth Vader come to Sora - 200+ characters for user-generated videos.

5
00:00:18,887 --> 00:00:25,900
AI Consciousness: Anthropic becomes first major lab to acknowledge Claude might have some form of consciousness.

6
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:34,200
Labor Market Alert: IMF chief warns of AI "tsunami" at Davos - 60% of jobs in advanced economies affected.

7
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,450
Story of the Week.

8
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:38,462
Apple and Google Forge Historic AI Pact.

9
00:00:38,462 --> 00:00:49,000
On January 12, Apple and Google announced a partnership that sent shockwaves through the tech world: Google's Gemini will power Apple's Siri and Apple Intelligence going forward .

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,162
The deal is estimated at one billion dollars per year .

11
00:00:52,162 --> 00:01:00,912
After careful evaluation, Apple determined that Google's AI technology provides the most capable foundation for Apple Foundation Models .

12
00:01:00,912 --> 00:01:11,875
The enhanced Siri is expected to arrive with iOS 26.4 in March or April, bringing better contextual understanding, screen awareness, and deeper app integration .

13
00:01:11,875 --> 00:01:17,675
The deal is non-exclusive - Apple's existing ChatGPT integration remains for now .

14
00:01:17,675 --> 00:01:24,375
Yet the message is clear: in the AI race, Apple is betting on Google rather than developing its own models.

15
00:01:24,375 --> 00:01:28,812
Critical perspective: For Google, this is an enormous validation win.

16
00:01:28,812 --> 00:01:34,212
For Apple, it's an admission that their own AI development couldn't keep pace with competitors.

17
00:01:34,212 --> 00:01:41,300
Users benefit from a potentially much smarter Siri - but must accept that their data now flows through Google's cloud as well.

18
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:48,062
Bottom Line: The biggest AI deal of the year shows that even tech giants can't build everything themselves.

19
00:01:48,062 --> 00:01:50,675
The AI future belongs to partnerships.

20
00:01:50,675 --> 00:01:52,012
More Top Stories.

21
00:01:52,012 --> 00:01:55,562
Disney Opens Its Universe to AI-Generated Videos.

22
00:01:55,562 --> 00:02:06,462
The Walt Disney Company and OpenAI have struck a three-year deal giving Sora access to over 200 animated characters - from Mickey and Minnie to Elsa to Star Wars figures .

23
00:02:06,462 --> 00:02:12,512
Disney is investing one billion dollars in OpenAI and receiving warrants for additional equity .

24
00:02:12,512 --> 00:02:18,037
Starting early 2026, users can create short videos with Disney characters.

25
00:02:18,037 --> 00:02:23,275
The generated content will also be showcased in curated selections on Disney+ .

26
00:02:23,275 --> 00:02:26,125
Real actor voices and likenesses are excluded.

27
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:29,212
Critical perspective: The deal cuts both ways.

28
00:02:29,212 --> 00:02:32,687
On one hand, it democratizes creative tools.

29
00:02:32,687 --> 00:02:39,775
On the other, a flood of AI-generated Disney content could dilute the brand and put pressure on human creators.

30
00:02:39,775 --> 00:02:43,175
Anthropic Acknowledges Possible AI Consciousness.

31
00:02:43,175 --> 00:02:56,950
In a fundamental overhaul of Claude's "constitution," Anthropic has taken a step no other AI lab has dared: the company acknowledges uncertainty about whether Claude might possess some kind of consciousness or moral status .

32
00:02:56,950 --> 00:03:04,800
The new constitution focuses on having Claude understand the reasoning behind behavioral rules - not just follow the rules themselves .

33
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:13,800
Anthropic is the only major AI lab with an internal "Model Welfare Team" investigating whether advanced AI systems could be conscious .

34
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:23,612
The positioning is paying off: Anthropic now holds 32% of the enterprise LLM market by usage - ahead of OpenAI's 25% .

35
00:03:23,612 --> 00:03:30,825
Bottom Line: While other labs treat AI as pure tooling, Anthropic ventures into philosophical territory.

36
00:03:30,825 --> 00:03:35,462
This might be marketing - or the beginning of a serious debate about AI rights.

37
00:03:35,462 --> 00:03:39,975
IMF Chief Warns: AI Hitting Labor Market Like a Tsunami.

38
00:03:39,975 --> 00:03:53,662
At Davos, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva painted a stark picture: 60% of all jobs in advanced economies will be affected by AI - through enhancement, transformation, or elimination .

39
00:03:53,662 --> 00:03:56,187
Globally, the figure is 40% .

40
00:03:56,187 --> 00:04:04,375
Particularly alarming: the middle class is getting squeezed while top earners benefit from AI and manual labor remains in demand .

41
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:10,825
Entry-level positions are disappearing rapidly, making it harder for young people to enter the workforce .

42
00:04:10,825 --> 00:04:18,337
Georgieva's message was clear: the world is not prepared, and technology is moving faster than regulators can follow .

43
00:04:18,337 --> 00:04:19,287
Quick Hits.

44
00:04:19,287 --> 00:04:20,275
In brief:.

45
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:28,600

48
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:50,225

50
00:04:58,037 --> 00:05:05,875
Anthropic in India: The AI lab opens an office in Bengaluru and appoints Irina Ghose as Managing Director India .

51
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:07,000
Tool of the Week.

52
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,500
Claude Code - The Unexpected Star.

53
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:13,612
What started as a developer tool for programmers has become a phenomenon .

54
00:05:13,612 --> 00:05:21,650
Users with zero programming experience now use Claude Code for tax filings, theater bookings, and even monitoring tomato plants .

55
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:27,812
Adoption is exploding: Claude's total audience has more than doubled since December 2024 .

56
00:05:27,812 --> 00:05:33,362
Enterprise customers like Uber, Netflix, Spotify, and Salesforce are on board .

57
00:05:33,362 --> 00:05:34,637
Try Claude Code

58
00:05:34,637 --> 00:05:35,787
Fail of the Week.

59
00:05:35,787 --> 00:05:37,325
"The Fine Print Changed"

60
00:05:37,325 --> 00:05:44,112
Anthropic caused an uproar when developers suddenly encountered drastically reduced usage limits for Claude Code .

61
00:05:44,112 --> 00:05:49,150
Complaints piled up in Anthropic's Discord channel about rapid token consumption .

62
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:52,912
Anthropic's explanation: a holiday bonus had expired.

63
00:05:52,912 --> 00:05:58,812
Developers saw it differently - many felt blindsided by changes without clear communication.

64
00:05:58,812 --> 00:06:04,637
Root Cause: Lack of transparency around pricing changes in a market built on trust.

65
00:06:04,637 --> 00:06:09,975
What we learn: Even with AI services, customers hate surprises about costs.

66
00:06:09,975 --> 00:06:11,112
Number of the Week.

67
00:06:11,112 --> 00:06:12,575
$1 Billion

68
00:06:12,575 --> 00:06:17,112
The amount Apple will reportedly pay Google annually for Gemini access .

69
00:06:17,112 --> 00:06:25,337
For comparison, Google already pays Apple an estimated $20 billion per year to be the default search engine on iPhones.

70
00:06:25,337 --> 00:06:29,475
The relationship between the two giants grows ever more intertwined.

71
00:06:29,475 --> 00:06:30,575
