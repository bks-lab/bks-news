00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:00,962
TL;DR.

2
00:00:00,962 --> 00:00:03,087
This week in 30 seconds:.

3
00:00:03,087 --> 00:00:10,900
Context Engineering: Anthropic defines the new skill - it's no longer about prompts, but about token configuration.

4
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:19,537
Devin's Review: 67% PR merge rate, 4x faster - but only 15% success rate on complex tasks.

5
00:00:19,537 --> 00:00:25,762
Microsoft Acquisition: Copilot has lost market share - coding startup acquisition expected.

6
00:00:25,762 --> 00:00:27,837
🎯 Technique of the Week

7
00:00:27,837 --> 00:00:30,950
Context Engineering Replaces Prompt Engineering.

8
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:35,225
Anthropic has published a new guide that's changing the developer landscape .

9
00:00:35,225 --> 00:00:36,650
The central thesis:.

10
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:48,700
"Building with language models is becoming less about finding the right words for your prompts, and more about answering: what configuration of context is most likely to generate our model's desired behavior?"

11
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,450
What is Context Engineering?

12
00:00:50,450 --> 00:01:03,837
Gartner defines it as : "Designing and structuring the relevant data, workflows and environment so AI systems can understand intent, make better decisions and deliver contextual, enterprise-aligned outcomes.".

13
00:01:03,837 --> 00:01:05,075
Why this matters:.

14
00:01:05,075 --> 00:01:07,675
Prompt Engineering  Context Engineering

15
00:01:07,675 --> 00:01:10,525
Focus on HOW to ask  Focus on WHAT to provide

16
00:01:10,525 --> 00:01:12,687
Single interaction  System design

17
00:01:12,687 --> 00:01:14,037
Static  Dynamic

18
00:01:14,037 --> 00:01:16,537
Anthropic's Three Core Principles:.

19
00:01:16,537 --> 00:01:20,925
1. Finite Attention Budget - Every token consumes attention.

20
00:01:20,925 --> 00:01:26,725
With n² pairwise relationships, precision decreases as context grows

21
00:01:26,725 --> 00:01:33,475
2. Just-In-Time Retrieval - Don't preload everything; store identifiers and fetch dynamically

22
00:01:33,475 --> 00:01:40,287
3. Goldilocks Zone - System prompts specific enough for guidance, flexible enough for heuristics

23
00:01:40,287 --> 00:01:45,050
Gartner's Recommendation: Companies should appoint a "Context Engineering Lead" .

24
00:01:45,050 --> 00:01:53,012
Bottom Line: Anyone working with AI agents in 2026 needs to master Context Engineering - not Prompt Engineering.

The Other Side: Answer.AI tested Devin for a month - result: only 15% success rate on 20 tasks .

41
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,437
The Pattern: Devin is a specialist, not a generalist.

42
00:02:52,437 --> 00:02:58,425
Best at repetitive tasks like migrations and refactoring - not creative product development .

43
00:02:58,425 --> 00:03:00,537
Microsoft Will Buy a Coding Startup.

44
00:03:00,537 --> 00:03:06,475
The Information predicts : Microsoft will acquire an AI coding startup in 2026.

45
00:03:06,475 --> 00:03:10,537
The Reason: GitHub Copilot has lost significant market share.

46
00:03:10,537 --> 00:03:11,900
Current distribution:.

47
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,112
Tool  Market Share

48
00:03:13,112 --> 00:03:15,712

54
00:03:29,075 --> 00:03:34,100
OpenAI already bought Windsurf (ex-Codeium) for $3B .

55
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:38,625
For developers who switched, an acquisition is the only path back .

56
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:44,050
Possible Targets: Cursor, Replit, or a smaller startup with strong technology.

🛠️ Tool of the Week

64
00:04:18,012 --> 00:04:20,037
Context Engineering Checklist.

65
00:04:20,037 --> 00:04:23,300
Based on Anthropic's Guide  - the key techniques:.

66
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,375
1. System Prompt Design

67
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:27,900
❌ Too vague: "Be helpful"

68
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:31,887
❌ Too rigid: "If X then Y, else Z"

69
00:04:31,887 --> 00:04:35,375
✅ Goldilocks: "You are a code reviewer.

70
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,800
Focus on security and performance.

71
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,325
Ask for clarification when unclear."

72
00:04:40,325 --> 00:04:41,875
2. Tool Design

73
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:44,425
Minimal, focused, clearly named .

74
00:04:44,425 --> 00:04:49,687
Rule of thumb: If a human wouldn't be sure which tool to use, it's too complex.

75
00:04:49,687 --> 00:04:51,575
3. Memory Management

76
00:04:51,575 --> 00:04:54,675
Compaction: Summarize conversation history .

77
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,225
Structured Notes: Persistent memory files outside the context window .

78
00:05:00,225 --> 00:05:03,825
Sub-Agents: Specialized agents for focused tasks .

79
00:05:03,825 --> 00:05:10,362
The Mantra: "The smallest set of high-signal tokens that maximize the likelihood of some desired outcome." .

80
00:05:10,362 --> 00:05:12,087
💥 Fail of the Week

81
00:05:12,087 --> 00:05:14,787
The 19% Slowdown Returns.

82
00:05:14,787 --> 00:05:19,975
The METR study from 2025 has been confirmed in new analyses :.

83
00:05:19,975 --> 00:05:28,800
The Problem: Experienced developers are 19% slower with AI tools on their own code - even though they believe they're 20% faster.

84
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:35,237
2026 Update: Stack Overflow's survey shows declining positive AI sentiments for the first time.

85
00:05:35,237 --> 00:05:36,962
The hype backlash is real .

86
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:38,287
Possible Reasons:.

87
00:05:38,287 --> 00:05:40,100
Context-switching overhead.

88
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,462
Overconfidence leads to less review.

89
00:05:42,462 --> 00:05:46,225
AI tools optimized for demos, not real codebases.

90
00:05:46,225 --> 00:05:52,575
The Lesson: "Show me the money" applies to developer productivity too - not just enterprise ROI .

91

The Context: Despite AI fears and layoffs at tech giants, demand is rising.

95
00:06:06,537 --> 00:06:11,800
The driver: AI, ML and cloud require more engineers, not fewer .

96
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,475
