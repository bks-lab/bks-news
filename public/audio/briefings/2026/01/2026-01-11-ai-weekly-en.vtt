00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,237
OpenAI Brings AI to Healthcare.

9
00:00:38,237 --> 00:00:48,187
On January 7, 2026, OpenAI announced ChatGPT Health – a dedicated AI environment for health questions with medical data integration .

10
00:00:48,187 --> 00:00:55,312
The numbers show the demand: Over 230 million users already ask health questions on the platform weekly .

11
00:00:55,312 --> 00:01:02,600
The new feature allows connection with Apple Health, MyFitnessPal, Function Labs, and other health apps through partner b.well .

12
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:07,800
Conversations remain in an isolated environment and are not used for model training .

13
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:17,425
"ChatGPT Health addresses healthcare system challenges including cost and access barriers, overbooked doctors, and a lack of continuity in care."

14
00:01:17,425 --> 00:01:21,025
— Fidji Simo, CEO of Applications at OpenAI

15
00:01:21,025 --> 00:01:28,687
Critical Voices: OpenAI's own Terms of Service emphasize that the tool is "not intended for diagnosis or treatment" .

16
00:01:28,687 --> 00:01:33,962
Large Language Models are prone to hallucinations – potentially dangerous in medicine.

17
00:01:33,962 --> 00:01:42,537
Regulatory questions remain open: No FDA approval was mentioned, nor liability issues for erroneous AI recommendations.

18
00:01:42,537 --> 00:01:49,512
Privacy advocates will likely question long-term storage of health data – despite HIPAA compliance for the Enterprise version.

19
00:01:49,512 --> 00:01:58,512
In parallel, OpenAI announced "OpenAI for Healthcare" for organizations – with HIPAA compliance and special enterprise features.

20
00:01:58,512 --> 00:02:00,712
Rollout begins in the coming weeks .

21
00:02:00,712 --> 00:02:09,037
Bottom Line: OpenAI makes the first major move into the healthcare market, but regulatory and ethical hurdles are enormous.

22
00:02:09,037 --> 00:02:13,062
Anyone making medical decisions here should proceed with caution.

55
00:05:48,212 --> 00:05:49,937
💥 Fail of the Week

56
00:05:49,937 --> 00:05:53,050
"Grok Generates Non-Consensual Deepfakes"

57
00:05:53,050 --> 00:06:03,687
Indonesian authorities temporarily blocked xAI's Grok chatbot after it became known that the platform can create sexualized deepfakes without consent of depicted persons .

58
00:06:03,687 --> 00:06:15,012
Root Cause: Missing content moderation and safety guardrails in image generation – a problem affecting many AI image generators, but especially critical for a public chatbot.

59
00:06:15,012 --> 00:06:21,537
What We Learn: Safety cannot be retrofitted – guardrails must be part of the architecture from day one.

60
00:06:21,537 --> 00:06:23,225
📊 Number of the Week

61
00:06:23,225 --> 00:06:25,387
$350 Billion

62
00:06:25,387 --> 00:06:29,075
The target valuation for Anthropic in the current funding round .

63
00:06:29,075 --> 00:06:37,812
For comparison: That would exceed Intel's market cap ($200B) and make Anthropic one of the most valuable private tech companies.

64
00:06:37,812 --> 00:06:43,725
The $10 billion investment would primarily flow into compute infrastructure and model training.
