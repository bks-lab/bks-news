1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:00,962
TL;DR.

2
00:00:00,962 --> 00:00:03,087
This week in 30 seconds:.

3
00:00:03,087 --> 00:00:09,950
DeepSeek Dilemma: China's AI lab shows efficiency breakthrough – but with significant security concerns.

4
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:18,587
CES 2026: Robots, smart glasses, and AI hardware dominate – Jensen Huang and Lisa Su keynote.

5
00:00:18,587 --> 00:00:26,950
IPO Fever: OpenAI plans $1 trillion IPO, Anthropic and SpaceX follow – analysts warn of bubble.

6
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:32,975
Claude Code: Impressive benchmarks, but reality is more nuanced than viral anecdotes.

7
00:00:32,975 --> 00:00:34,225
Story of the Week.

8
00:00:34,225 --> 00:00:38,037
DeepSeek: Efficiency Breakthrough with Security Questions.

9
00:00:38,037 --> 00:00:45,900
Chinese AI startup DeepSeek has kicked off 2026 with a technical paper that rethinks the fundamentals of AI training .

10
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:53,037
The method called Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections (mHC) promises more stable training at lower costs.

11
00:00:53,037 --> 00:01:03,437
The numbers are impressive: The 19-member research team led by Zhenda Xie tested mHC on models with 3, 9, and 27 billion parameters.

12
00:01:03,437 --> 00:01:11,137
The result: "Effectively stable large-scale training with superior scalability" at "negligible computational overhead" .

13
00:01:11,137 --> 00:01:14,262
Analysts call the approach a "breakthrough for scaling" .

14
00:01:14,262 --> 00:01:21,550
The Other Side: What the efficiency hype ignores – CSIS and NIST have documented significant security concerns :.

15
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:29,400
DeepSeek-R1 blocks 0% of jailbreak prompts (vs. GPT-4o: 86%).

16
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:33,662
11x more likely to produce harmful outputs than US models

17
00:01:33,662 --> 00:01:37,437
All data stored in China – with known links to state entities .

18
00:01:37,437 --> 00:01:48,200
Geopolitical Context: While OpenAI and Microsoft invest trillions in compute, DeepSeek shows that clever architecture can partially compensate for hardware disadvantages.

19
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:55,025
However: The US maintains a 21-49x compute advantage (if export controls hold) .

20
00:01:55,025 --> 00:01:59,662
Pentagon and Capitol Hill have already banned DeepSeek for official use.

21
00:01:59,662 --> 00:02:04,962
What's Next: Analysts expect the launch of DeepSeek R2 before Chinese New Year .

22
00:02:04,962 --> 00:02:13,400
Bottom Line: DeepSeek proves software innovation, but security risks make enterprise deployment in critical systems problematic.

23
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:17,562
The real test: Can efficiency compensate for the chip gap long-term?

24
00:02:17,562 --> 00:02:18,900
More Top Stories.

25
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:23,712

26
00:02:23,712 --> 00:02:29,825
The Consumer Electronics Show opens January 6 in Las Vegas – and AI is everywhere .

27
00:02:29,825 --> 00:02:39,162
Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and AMD CEO Lisa Su are delivering keynotes, while over 4,000 exhibitors showcase AI hardware.

28
00:02:39,162 --> 00:02:40,225
The highlights:.

29
00:02:40,225 --> 00:02:48,337
Robotics Explosion: LG's "CLOiD" home robot, SwitchBot's "Onero H1", Narwal's AI vacuum .

30
00:02:48,337 --> 00:02:55,112
Smart Glasses: Google announces two Gemini glasses for 2026 – with and without display .

31
00:02:55,112 --> 00:03:03,975
On-Device AI: Intel's Panther Lake chips with 18A technology, LG's "world's lightest 17-inch RTX laptop" .

32
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:11,550
Reality Check: Analysts warn of overhype – many products will "overpromise and underdeliver on AI features" .

33
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:17,975
The real advances lie in on-device AI and robotics (1000+ units already deployed).

34
00:03:17,975 --> 00:03:21,812
The Year of Trillion-Dollar IPOs – With Warning Signs.

35
00:03:21,812 --> 00:03:25,887
2026 could be the biggest tech IPO year in history .

36
00:03:25,887 --> 00:03:26,862
The numbers:

37
00:03:26,862 --> 00:03:29,262
Company  Target Valuation  Timeline

38
00:03:29,262 --> 00:03:33,162
OpenAI  up to $1 trillion  Late 2026

39
00:03:33,162 --> 00:03:37,700
SpaceX  $30+ billion  June 2026

40
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:40,650
Anthropic  TBD  Preparation ongoing

41
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:43,925
Sam Altman called an IPO the "most likely path" .

42
00:03:43,925 --> 00:03:47,275
Anthropic has hired Wilson Sonsini for preparation .

43
00:03:47,275 --> 00:03:52,225
The Warning: Neither OpenAI nor Anthropic are financially transparent.

44
00:03:52,225 --> 00:03:59,175
We know expected revenues (OpenAI: $30B in 2026), but not profitability .

45
00:03:59,175 --> 00:04:08,375
Historical parallel: Nvidia survived the dot-com bubble in 1999 – but only reached $5 trillion valuation in 2025.

46
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:10,625
The journey took 26 years .

47
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:11,575
Quick Hits.

48
00:04:11,575 --> 00:04:12,562
In brief:.

49
00:04:12,562 --> 00:04:21,112
Gemini 3 @-Menu: Google's new model switcher enables quick switching between @Fast, @Thinking, and @Pro via keyboard .

50
00:04:21,112 --> 00:04:30,550
MCP Becomes Standard: OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google adopt Anthropic's Model Context Protocol – Linux Foundation takes governance .

51
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:39,025
Chip Rally: ASML +9%, Micron +10% at year start – AI demand drives semiconductor stocks .

52
00:04:39,025 --> 00:04:40,050
End of Scaling?

53
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:44,950
Yann LeCun and Ilya Sutskever argue that current scaling laws are plateauing .

54
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:53,362
World Models: Google DeepMind's Genie, World Labs' Marble, and Runway's GWM-1 drive new research focus .

55
00:04:53,362 --> 00:04:54,487
Tool of the Week.

56
00:04:54,487 --> 00:04:57,775
Claude Code - Productivity Boost with Nuance.

57
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:10,562
Jaana Dogan, Principal Engineer at Google (Gemini API team), shared on X: She gave Claude Code a problem description and received a working system in one hour that her team has been building for a year .

58
00:05:10,562 --> 00:05:19,150
The Benchmark Reality: Claude Code achieves 80.9% on SWE-bench – a legitimate benchmark for code generation.

59
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:25,250
Typical productivity gains are 50-75% error reduction for repetitive tasks .

60
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:33,600
However: A randomized study showed: Experienced developers with AI tools on their own code sometimes took 19% longer.

61
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,250
The effect depends heavily on the use case .

62
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:49,875
Boris Cherry from the Claude Code team: 259 pull requests in 30 days – 497 commits, 40,000 lines added – "every line written by Claude Code + Opus 4.5" .

64
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:52,275
Fail of the Week.

65
00:05:52,275 --> 00:05:54,975
"The Security Gap No One Wants to See"

66
00:05:54,975 --> 00:06:00,687
While DeepSeek is celebrated for efficiency, NIST evaluations paint a different picture :.

67
00:06:00,687 --> 00:06:05,700
The Problem: DeepSeek-R1 blocks 0% of jailbreak prompts.

68
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:11,975
For comparison: GPT-4o blocks 86%, Gemini 64% .

69
00:06:11,975 --> 00:06:20,575
Root Cause: Missing or inadequate safety guardrails during rapid scale-up – a problem that systematically affects Chinese AI labs .

70
00:06:20,575 --> 00:06:25,437
Lesson Learned: Efficiency without safety isn't innovation – it's a risk.

71
00:06:25,437 --> 00:06:28,487
Pentagon and Capitol Hill have already responded.

72
00:06:28,487 --> 00:06:29,625
Number of the Week.

73
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:32,550
37% vs. 14%

74
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:38,812
37% of US companies plan to replace jobs with AI by end of 2026 .

75
00:06:38,812 --> 00:06:39,837
But reality?

76
00:06:39,837 --> 00:06:42,912
Only 14% have actually replaced positions .

77
00:06:42,912 --> 00:06:48,387
This expectations-reality gap shows: Many announcements, less implementation.

78
00:06:48,387 --> 00:06:51,562
The most vulnerable groups according to Goldman Sachs:.

79
00:06:51,562 --> 00:06:54,362
High-salary employees without AI skills.

80
00:06:54,362 --> 00:06:56,012
Recently hired workers.

81
00:06:56,012 --> 00:06:57,612
Entry-level positions .

82
00:06:57,612 --> 00:07:07,300
Context: In 2025, 55,000 US jobs were directly attributed to AI – out of 1.17 million total layoffs .

83
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:08,400
Reading List.

84
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:09,400
