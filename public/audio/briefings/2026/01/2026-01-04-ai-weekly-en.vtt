## Story of the Week

11
00:00:47,287 --> 00:00:53,200
### DeepSeek: Efficiency Breakthrough with Security Questions

12
00:00:53,200 --> 00:01:01,062
Chinese AI startup DeepSeek has kicked off 2026 with a technical paper that rethinks the fundamentals of AI training .

13
00:01:01,062 --> 00:01:08,200
The method called Manifold-Constrained Hyper-Connections (mHC) promises more stable training at lower costs.

14
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:18,600
The numbers are impressive: The 19-member research team led by Zhenda Xie tested mHC on models with 3, 9, and 27 billion parameters.

15
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:26,300
The result: "Effectively stable large-scale training with superior scalability" at "negligible computational overhead" .

16
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:29,425
Analysts call the approach a "breakthrough for scaling" .

17
00:01:29,425 --> 00:01:36,712
The Other Side: What the efficiency hype ignores – CSIS and NIST have documented significant security concerns :.

18
00:01:36,712 --> 00:01:44,500
- DeepSeek-R1 blocks 0% of jailbreak prompts (vs. GPT-4o: 86%)

19
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:48,675
- 11x more likely to produce harmful outputs than US models

20
00:01:48,675 --> 00:01:52,462
- All data stored in China – with known links to state entities

21
00:01:52,462 --> 00:02:03,225
Geopolitical Context: While OpenAI and Microsoft invest trillions in compute, DeepSeek shows that clever architecture can partially compensate for hardware disadvantages.

22
00:02:03,225 --> 00:02:10,050
However: The US maintains a 21-49x compute advantage (if export controls hold) .

23
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:14,687
Pentagon and Capitol Hill have already banned DeepSeek for official use.

24
00:02:14,687 --> 00:02:19,987
What's Next: Analysts expect the launch of DeepSeek R2 before Chinese New Year .

25
00:02:19,987 --> 00:02:28,425
Bottom Line: DeepSeek proves software innovation, but security risks make enterprise deployment in critical systems problematic.

26
00:02:28,425 --> 00:02:32,587
The real test: Can efficiency compensate for the chip gap long-term?

27
00:02:32,587 --> 00:02:34,962
## More Top Stories

28
00:02:34,962 --> 00:02:41,387
### CES 2026: The AI Hardware Revolution Begins

29
00:02:41,387 --> 00:02:47,500
The Consumer Electronics Show opens January 6 in Las Vegas – and AI is everywhere .

30
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:56,837
Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and AMD CEO Lisa Su are delivering keynotes, while over 4,000 exhibitors showcase AI hardware.

31
00:02:56,837 --> 00:02:57,900
The highlights:.

32
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:06,062
- Robotics Explosion: LG's "CLOiD" home robot, SwitchBot's "Onero H1", Narwal's AI vacuum

33
00:03:06,062 --> 00:03:12,812
- Smart Glasses: Google announces two Gemini glasses for 2026 – with and without display

34
00:03:12,812 --> 00:03:21,625
- On-Device AI: Intel's Panther Lake chips with 18A technology, LG's "world's lightest 17-inch RTX laptop"

35
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:29,200
Reality Check: Analysts warn of overhype – many products will "overpromise and underdeliver on AI features" .

36
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:35,625
The real advances lie in on-device AI and robotics (1000+ units already deployed).

37
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:41,137
### The Year of Trillion-Dollar IPOs – With Warning Signs

38
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:45,212
2026 could be the biggest tech IPO year in history .

39
00:03:45,212 --> 00:03:46,187
The numbers:

40
00:03:46,187 --> 00:03:48,587
Company  Target Valuation  Timeline

41
00:03:48,587 --> 00:03:52,487
OpenAI  up to $1 trillion  Late 2026

42
00:03:52,487 --> 00:03:57,025
SpaceX  $30+ billion  June 2026

43
00:03:57,025 --> 00:03:59,975
Anthropic  TBD  Preparation ongoing

44
00:03:59,975 --> 00:04:03,250
Sam Altman called an IPO the "most likely path" .

45
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:06,600
Anthropic has hired Wilson Sonsini for preparation .

46
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:11,550
The Warning: Neither OpenAI nor Anthropic are financially transparent.

47
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:18,500
We know expected revenues (OpenAI: $30B in 2026), but not profitability .

48
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:27,700
Historical parallel: Nvidia survived the dot-com bubble in 1999 – but only reached $5 trillion valuation in 2025.

49
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,950
The journey took 26 years .

50
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:31,912
## Quick Hits

51
00:04:31,912 --> 00:04:32,900
In brief:.

52
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:41,550
- Gemini 3 @-Menu: Google's new model switcher enables quick switching between @Fast, @Thinking, and @Pro via keyboard

53
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:51,025
- MCP Becomes Standard: OpenAI, Microsoft, and Google adopt Anthropic's Model Context Protocol – Linux Foundation takes governance

54
00:04:51,025 --> 00:04:59,362
- Chip Rally: ASML +9%, Micron +10% at year start – AI demand drives semiconductor stocks

55
00:04:59,362 --> 00:05:00,425
- End of Scaling?

56
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:05,325
Yann LeCun and Ilya Sutskever argue that current scaling laws are plateauing

57
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:14,650
- World Models: Google DeepMind's Genie, World Labs' Marble, and Runway's GWM-1 drive new research focus

58
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:16,875
## Tool of the Week

59
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:20,162
Claude Code - Productivity Boost with Nuance.

60
00:05:20,162 --> 00:05:32,075
Jaana Dogan, Principal Engineer at Google (Gemini API team), shared on X: She gave Claude Code a problem description and received a working system in one hour that her team has been building for a year .

61
00:05:32,075 --> 00:05:40,662
The Benchmark Reality: Claude Code achieves 80.9% on SWE-bench – a legitimate benchmark for code generation.

62
00:05:40,662 --> 00:05:46,762
Typical productivity gains are 50-75% error reduction for repetitive tasks .

63
00:05:46,762 --> 00:05:55,112
However: A randomized study showed: Experienced developers with AI tools on their own code sometimes took 19% longer.

64
00:05:55,112 --> 00:05:57,762
The effect depends heavily on the use case .

65
00:05:57,762 --> 00:06:11,387
Boris Cherry from the Claude Code team: 259 pull requests in 30 days – 497 commits, 40,000 lines added – "every line written by Claude Code + Opus 4.5" .

66
00:06:11,387 --> 00:06:12,637
Claude Code Docs

67
00:06:12,637 --> 00:06:14,912
## Fail of the Week

68
00:06:14,912 --> 00:06:17,612
"The Security Gap No One Wants to See"

69
00:06:17,612 --> 00:06:23,325
While DeepSeek is celebrated for efficiency, NIST evaluations paint a different picture :.

70
00:06:23,325 --> 00:06:28,337
The Problem: DeepSeek-R1 blocks 0% of jailbreak prompts.

71
00:06:28,337 --> 00:06:34,612
For comparison: GPT-4o blocks 86%, Gemini 64% .

72
00:06:34,612 --> 00:06:43,212
Root Cause: Missing or inadequate safety guardrails during rapid scale-up – a problem that systematically affects Chinese AI labs .

73
00:06:43,212 --> 00:06:48,075
Lesson Learned: Efficiency without safety isn't innovation – it's a risk.

74
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:51,125
Pentagon and Capitol Hill have already responded.

75
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:53,412
## Number of the Week

76
00:06:53,412 --> 00:06:56,337
37% vs. 14%

77
00:06:56,337 --> 00:07:02,600
37% of US companies plan to replace jobs with AI by end of 2026 .

78
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,625
But reality?

79
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:06,700
Only 14% have actually replaced positions .

80
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:12,175
This expectations-reality gap shows: Many announcements, less implementation.

81
00:07:12,175 --> 00:07:15,350
The most vulnerable groups according to Goldman Sachs:.

82
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:18,175
- High-salary employees without AI skills

83
00:07:18,175 --> 00:07:19,887
- Recently hired workers

84
00:07:19,887 --> 00:07:21,525
- Entry-level positions

85
00:07:21,525 --> 00:07:31,212
Context: In 2025, 55,000 US jobs were directly attributed to AI – out of 1.17 million total layoffs .

86
00:07:31,212 --> 00:07:33,387
## Reading List

87
00:07:33,387 --> 00:07:34,387
