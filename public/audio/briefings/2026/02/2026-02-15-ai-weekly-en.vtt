# AI Weekly #7/2026

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:07,850
February 15, 2026  Week 7.

3
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:08,812
TL;DR.

4
00:00:08,812 --> 00:00:17,750
$380 Billion: Anthropic closes $30B Series G – second-largest private tech funding of all time

5
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:26,212
AI Geopolitics Escalate: OpenAI officially accuses DeepSeek before US lawmakers of systematic model distillation .

6
00:00:26,212 --> 00:00:36,237
Healthcare AI Crisis: ECRI declares chatbot misuse the #1 patient safety risk for 2026 – just as FDA loosens requirements .

7
00:00:36,237 --> 00:00:45,837
Chinese Offensive: DeepSeek V4, Alibaba Qwen 3.5, ByteDance, and Zhipu prepare coordinated launches during Lunar New Year .

8
00:00:45,837 --> 00:00:54,112
Story of the Week: Anthropic Raises $30B at $380B Valuation – While Software Stocks Crash.

9
00:00:54,112 --> 00:01:00,412
Since its founding in 2021, Anthropic is now valued at $380 billion.

10
00:01:00,412 --> 00:01:10,437
The Series G funding round brought in $30 billion in fresh capital – the second-largest private tech financing in history, surpassed only by OpenAI .

11
00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:19,400
For perspective: This valuation exceeds BMW, Airbus, and Siemens combined – for a company primarily selling a chat model.

12
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:24,525
Yet while foundation model labs raise billions, the stock market tells a different story.

13
00:01:24,525 --> 00:01:33,175
In the same week, software stocks fell sharply – not just tech, but also financials, office real estate, trucking, and logistics .

14
00:01:33,175 --> 00:01:39,037
The reason: Investors fear that AI agents will make traditional enterprise software obsolete.

15
00:01:39,037 --> 00:01:43,912
This paradox reveals the fundamental capital redistribution currently underway.

16
00:01:43,912 --> 00:01:49,400
Money is flowing away from companies that use software toward those that build foundation models.

17
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:56,400
Markets aren't just pricing in that AI is disruptive – they're already evaluating who the winners and losers will be.

18
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:59,475
What will Anthropic do with $30 billion?

19
00:01:59,475 --> 00:02:12,962
The company remains silent on details, but the timing signals are clear: While OpenAI pushes GPT-5.x and DeepSeek V4 launches next week, Claude needs massive capital for the compute race.

20
00:02:12,962 --> 00:02:19,725
Foundation models have become a capital-intensive industry – those who can't burn billions no longer compete.

21
00:02:19,725 --> 00:02:31,587
The $380B valuation isn't an assessment of Anthropic's current profitability – it's a bet that Claude will be one of the few survivors in the foundation model consolidation process.

22
00:02:31,587 --> 00:02:39,175
In a world with 5-7 Tier-1 labs, $380B is the price for a seat at the table.

23
00:02:39,175 --> 00:02:40,600
Further Top Stories.

24
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:47,312
Google DeepMind: Gemini Deep Think Achieves IMO Gold Standard and Solves Open Erdős Problems.

25
00:02:47,312 --> 00:02:57,050
Google DeepMind has introduced Gemini Deep Think – a reasoning model that achieves the gold medal standard of the International Mathematics Olympiad (IMO) .

26
00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:08,650
Even more remarkable: The new "Aletheia" research agent feature solved four open problems from the Erdős Conjectures Database – a collection of mathematical conjectures, some decades old.

27
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:10,575
This is more than a benchmark win.

28
00:03:10,575 --> 00:03:18,850
DeepMind explicitly positions Gemini Deep Think not as a "tool for mathematicians" but as an active scientific research partner.

29
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:32,787
The model also achieved competition-level performance in the ICPC (International Collegiate Programming Contest), demonstrating that the capability applies not only to formal mathematics but also to algorithmic problem-solving.

30
00:03:32,787 --> 00:03:36,325
The four solved Erdős problems are historically significant.

31
00:03:36,325 --> 00:03:47,262
Paul Erdős was one of the most prolific mathematicians of the 20th century – his "Conjectures Database" contains hundreds of open conjectures that mathematicians worldwide work on.

32
00:03:47,262 --> 00:03:55,662
That an AI system now independently finds solutions could mark a turning point: AI is evolving from assistant to co-researcher.

33
00:03:55,662 --> 00:03:59,200
For Scientific AI, this represents a narrative shift.

34
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:04,712
Previous systems (AlphaFold, AlphaProof) solved specific scientific problems.

35
00:04:04,712 --> 00:04:14,425
Gemini Deep Think demonstrates generalized reasoning capability across multiple domains – mathematics, programming, scientific hypotheses.

36
00:04:14,425 --> 00:04:20,887
This is the foundation for AI as a "general scientific discoverer," not just a specialized tool.

37
00:04:20,887 --> 00:04:27,162
OpenAI Officially Accuses DeepSeek of Model Distillation – AI Becomes Geopolitical.

38
00:04:28,087 --> 00:04:36,950
OpenAI has officially warned US lawmakers about DeepSeek, accusing the Chinese lab of "unfair and increasingly sophisticated methods" .

39
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:51,062
The specific accusation: DeepSeek systematically extracts output from US models (GPT-4, Claude, Gemini) to train the R1 successor DeepSeek V4 – a process called "model distillation.".

40
00:04:51,062 --> 00:04:57,225
This is the first direct IP accusation between Tier-1 labs across national borders.

41
00:04:57,225 --> 00:05:10,850
Distillation is technically legal (it's only inference, not weight theft), but OpenAI argues: If DeepSeek systematically uses billions of API calls to train a competing model, it's unfair competition.

42
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:12,525
The timing is strategic.

43
00:05:12,525 --> 00:05:22,137
According to Bloomberg, DeepSeek V4 is expected next week during Lunar New Year  – exactly like a year ago when DeepSeek-R1 caused a stir.

44
00:05:22,137 --> 00:05:26,875
OpenAI is proactively trying to build political pressure before the launch occurs.

45
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:29,250
The geopolitical dimension is new.

46
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:35,387
Previous AI competition operated at the benchmark level – now it's becoming a matter for lawmakers.

47
00:05:35,387 --> 00:05:42,812
OpenAI frames DeepSeek not just as a competitor but as a state-backed actor systematically exploiting US IP.

48
00:05:42,812 --> 00:05:47,987
This is classic geopolitics: Technical competition becomes state competition.

49
00:05:47,987 --> 00:05:53,387
For the industry, this means: Model distillation will become a regulatory issue.

50
00:05:53,387 --> 00:06:05,075
If US labs successfully argue that Chinese distillation is unfair, API restrictions could follow – which in turn forces Chinese labs toward more autarky (their own infrastructure).

51
00:06:05,075 --> 00:06:07,775
The AI race is fragmenting regionally.

52
00:06:07,775 --> 00:06:16,025
Healthcare AI Crisis: Chatbot Misuse Becomes #1 Patient Safety Risk – Just as FDA Loosens Requirements.

53
00:06:16,025 --> 00:06:25,362
ECRI, a leading nonprofit patient safety organization, has declared AI chatbot misuse the #1 health tech hazard for 2026 .

54
00:06:25,362 --> 00:06:39,287
The problem: ChatGPT, Gemini, and Microsoft Copilot are being deployed in healthcare settings without clinical oversight – doctors and nurses use them for diagnoses, medication recommendations, and patient counseling.

55
00:06:39,287 --> 00:06:41,000
The timing is problematic.

56
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:47,450
In January 2026, the FDA loosened device requirements for Clinical Decision Support Tools.

57
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:52,225
Result: AI tools can now be deployed in clinics without FDA vetting.

58
00:06:52,225 --> 00:06:55,887
At exactly this moment, ECRI warns of the risks.

59
00:06:55,887 --> 00:06:58,250
The core problems according to ECRI:.

60
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:03,575
Hallucinations: ChatGPT invents medical "facts" that sound plausible.

61
00:07:03,575 --> 00:07:10,475
No clinical validation: GPT-4 is not a medical device – it was never tested for healthcare use.

62
00:07:10,475 --> 00:07:15,962
Lack of liability: If a patient is harmed by AI misadvice – who is responsible?

63
00:07:15,962 --> 00:07:17,912
This isn't a theoretical risk.

64
00:07:17,912 --> 00:07:25,287
Healthcare professionals already report cases where colleagues adopted ChatGPT output verbatim – without fact-checking.

65
00:07:25,287 --> 00:07:33,287
The FDA loosening exacerbates the problem: Tools previously considered "experimental" are now deemed "acceptable.".

66
00:07:33,287 --> 00:07:44,300
At the same time, there are positive examples of AI in healthcare: Radiology assistants helping doctors with diagnoses, or administrative copilots reducing documentation burden.

67
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:53,637
The difference lies in validation and supervision – clinically tested tools with human oversight work, general-purpose chatbots without oversight are risky.

68
00:07:53,637 --> 00:07:59,237
This shows the central trade-off: Not slowing innovation vs. ensuring patient safety.

69
00:07:59,237 --> 00:08:06,625
The FDA tries to balance both, but the current approach – loose requirements for AI tools – may have come too early.

70
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:14,712
Healthcare is the first safety-critical use case where general-purpose AI is being mass-deployed – without domain-specific safeguards.

71
00:08:14,712 --> 00:08:15,662
Quick Hits.

72
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:24,175
OpenAI Tests Ads in ChatGPT Free Tier  – Despite billion-dollar fundings, all labs need sustainable revenue streams.

73
00:08:24,175 --> 00:08:29,212
ChatGPT Free gets advertising, partners pay premium rates for placement.

74
00:08:29,212 --> 00:08:43,612
OpenAI Retired GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, and o4-mini from ChatGPT  – Aggressive model lifecycle: GPT-4o removed from ChatGPT after less than a year.

75
00:08:43,612 --> 00:08:49,687
API remains, but ChatGPT pushes users to GPT-5.x series.

76
00:08:49,687 --> 00:08:54,387
Signal: OpenAI wants to force rapid adoption of newest models.

77
00:08:55,312 --> 00:09:05,425
Software Stocks Fall Due to AI Agent Disruption Fears  – Global software stocks (financials, office real estate, trucking, logistics) fall sharply.

78
00:09:05,425 --> 00:09:10,200
Investors fear: AI agents replace traditional enterprise software.

79
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,712
Same week Anthropic receives $30B.

80
00:09:13,712 --> 00:09:20,875
Tool of the Week: Mistral Voxtral Transcribe 2 – On-Device Speech-to-Text for 1/5 of Cloud Costs.

81
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:29,812
Mistral AI has launched Voxtral Transcribe 2 – an open-weights speech-to-text model that's more practical and cheaper than all cloud alternatives .

82
00:09:29,812 --> 00:09:30,987
Two Variants:.

83
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:43,562
Voxtral Mini: 13 languages, speaker diarization, $0.003/min (vs. GPT-4o mini: ~$0.015/min).

84
00:09:43,562 --> 00:09:48,912
Voxtral Realtime: Sub-200ms latency for live transcription.

85
00:09:48,912 --> 00:09:50,262
What Makes It Special:.

86
00:09:50,262 --> 00:09:55,675
Open-Weights: Apache 2.0 License – can run on-device (privacy!).

87
00:09:55,675 --> 00:10:01,000
Performance: Outperforms GPT-4o mini at 1/5 the cost.

88
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,150
Practical: Not just a benchmark win – real cost savings for production use.

89
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:07,212
Why Relevant:.

90
00:10:07,212 --> 00:10:10,087
This is the counter-trend to cloud-only AI.

91
00:10:10,087 --> 00:10:17,700
While OpenAI and Anthropic burn billions for larger models, Mistral shows: Open source can lead with practical tools.

92
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:28,687
On-device processing is privacy-first (GDPR-compliant without cloud), cheaper (no API costs after deployment), and low-latency (no network round-trip).

93
00:10:28,687 --> 00:10:35,150
Voxtral Transcribe 2 isn't a research project – it's a production-ready tool that companies can deploy today.

94
00:10:35,150 --> 00:10:42,050
This is the AI story lost beneath the funding hype: Practical open-source tools solving real problems.

95
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:49,487
Fail of the Week: FDA Loosens Clinical AI Requirements Just as ECRI Warns of Chatbot Misuse.

96
00:10:49,487 --> 00:10:55,937
In January 2026, the FDA loosened device requirements for Clinical Decision Support Tools.

97
00:10:55,937 --> 00:11:02,125
In the same month, ECRI warns of AI chatbot misuse as the #1 health tech hazard .

98
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:03,462
Timing Paradox:.

99
00:11:03,462 --> 00:11:06,637
FDA says: "AI tools need less vetting".

100
00:11:06,637 --> 00:11:11,787
ECRI says: "AI tools without vetting are the greatest patient safety threat".

101
00:11:11,787 --> 00:11:17,412
Result: ChatGPT/Gemini deployed in clinics without FDA check.

102
00:11:17,412 --> 00:11:21,550
This shows the disconnect between regulation and safety reality.

103
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:27,775
Policy-makers want to "not slow innovation," while patient safety organizations warn of the risks.

104
00:11:27,775 --> 00:11:37,187
The result is tension: AI tools can be used in healthcare without comprehensive validation – with potential for liability and oversight problems.

105
00:11:37,187 --> 00:11:46,825
The central trade-off: Too strict regulation slows innovation and prevents positive use cases (diagnostic assistants, administrative copilots).

106
00:11:46,825 --> 00:11:51,687
Too loose regulation enables risky deployments without clinical validation.

107
00:11:51,687 --> 00:11:58,312
The FDA tries to find balance – but the current approach may be too permissive for safety-critical settings.

108
00:11:58,312 --> 00:12:01,775
Number of the Week: $380 Billion.

109
00:12:01,775 --> 00:12:06,625
Anthropic's post-money valuation after $30B Series G .

110
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:07,687
Why Relevant:.

111
00:12:07,687 --> 00:12:11,450
Second-largest private tech valuation after OpenAI.

112
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:15,025
More than BMW, Airbus, Siemens combined.

113
00:12:15,025 --> 00:12:17,825
For a company primarily selling a chat model.

114
00:12:17,825 --> 00:12:19,000
The Contrast:.

115
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:26,150
Same week Anthropic is worth $380B, software stocks fall from fear of AI disruption .

116
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:32,012
Shows capital redistribution: Away from traditional software, toward foundation model labs.

117
00:12:32,012 --> 00:12:40,325
$380B isn't a valuation of profit – it's the price for a seat in the Tier-1 AI lab oligopoly.

118
00:12:40,325 --> 00:12:41,425

Next Week: Chinese AI Launches & DeepSeek V4.

123
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:20,937
Next week begins Lunar New Year – and with it the coordinated offensive of Chinese AI labs.

124
00:13:20,937 --> 00:13:28,225
According to the South China Morning Post (SCMP), a Hong Kong-based newspaper, several major launches are expected :.

125
00:13:28,225 --> 00:13:35,325
DeepSeek V4: Successor to R1, context window 128K → 1M tokens.

126
00:13:35,325 --> 00:13:39,075
Alibaba Qwen 3.5: Flagship update.

127
00:13:39,075 --> 00:13:43,762
ByteDance & Zhipu GLM-5: Further major launches.

128
00:13:44,687 --> 00:13:46,275
This is no coincidence.

129
00:13:46,275 --> 00:13:54,612
A year after DeepSeek's first breakthrough, Lunar New Year becomes the "AI launch window" – similar to Apple's September events.

130
00:13:54,612 --> 00:13:58,675
Shows professionalism and coordination in the Chinese AI sector.

131
00:13:58,675 --> 00:14:01,662
