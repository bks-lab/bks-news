TL;DR.

2
00:00:00,962 --> 00:00:08,087
Claude Opus 4.6 makes history with 500 discovered zero-day vulnerabilities and Agent Teams.

3
00:00:08,087 --> 00:00:13,075
OpenAI counters with Frontier, an enterprise platform for AI agents.

4
00:00:13,075 --> 00:00:19,875
Big Tech doubles down: $650 billion for AI infrastructure in 2026.

5
00:00:19,875 --> 00:00:23,425
Google Gemini hits 750 million users.

6
00:00:23,425 --> 00:00:28,487
Software stocks lose $1 trillion – AI eats its children first.

00:00:28,487 --> 00:00:30,400
🌟 Story of the Week

8
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,712
Claude Opus 4.6: The Security Shock.

9
00:00:33,712 --> 00:00:40,912
Anthropic ushered in a new era this week with Claude Opus 4.6 – and shook the software industry along the way.

10
00:00:40,912 --> 00:00:49,925
The new model found over 500 previously unknown zero-day vulnerabilities in open-source code , "out of the box," without special training.

11
00:00:49,925 --> 00:00:55,787
Every single vulnerability was verified by Anthropic's team or external security researchers .

12
00:00:55,787 --> 00:00:57,300
But that's just the beginning.

13
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:00,362
Opus 4.6 brings three game-changers:.

14
00:01:00,362 --> 00:01:02,050
1. Agent Teams

15
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:10,362
The model can now break down complex tasks into subtasks and distribute them across multiple agents that coordinate directly with each other .

16
00:01:10,362 --> 00:01:17,350
Instead of a single AI assistant, you get an entire crew working together – perfect for enterprise workflows.

17
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:20,287
2. 1 Million Token Context Window

18
00:01:20,287 --> 00:01:25,887
Anthropic expanded the context window from 200,000 to 1 million tokens .

19
00:01:25,887 --> 00:01:30,600
That's about 750,000 words or 2,000 pages of text.

20
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:36,012
Regulatory filings, annual reports, complete codebases – everything fits.

21
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:38,850
3. Financial Analysis Superpowers

22
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:44,100
Goldman Sachs is already using Claude to automate trade accounting and client onboarding .

23
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:53,675
Opus 4.6 can analyze company data, regulations, and market information to create detailed financial analyses that would take a human days .

24
00:01:53,675 --> 00:01:59,162
The market reaction was brutal: Legal and financial analysis software stocks crashed .

25
00:01:59,162 --> 00:02:04,412
The WisdomTree Cloud Computing Fund lost 20% in 2026 already .

26
00:02:04,412 --> 00:02:11,175
The message is clear: AI isn't just coming for blue-collar jobs – it's eating high-margin SaaS first.

27
00:02:11,175 --> 00:02:12,787
🔥 More Top Stories

28
00:02:12,787 --> 00:02:17,250
1. OpenAI Frontier: Enterprise Agents for Everyone

29
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:24,625
OpenAI strikes back with Frontier , a new platform that allows companies to treat AI agents like human employees.

30
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:34,112
Frontier connects different data sources across enterprise applications and allows agents to take actions: edit files, use tools, execute code .

31
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:42,562
The first customers are impressive: HP, Intuit, Oracle, State Farm, Thermo Fisher, and Uber are already onboard .

32
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:46,687
BBVA, Cisco, and T-Mobile have piloted the platform .

33
00:02:46,687 --> 00:03:01,537
Together with GPT-5.3-Codex , which combines code generation with GPT-5 reasoning and is 25% faster than predecessors, OpenAI is building a complete enterprise AI ecosystem.

34
00:03:01,537 --> 00:03:05,925
2. Big Tech's $650B AI Bet

35
00:03:05,925 --> 00:03:17,850
The four largest US tech giants – Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft – will invest about $650 billion in AI infrastructure together in 2026 .

36
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:31,112
Alphabet alone announced capex of $175-185 billion , almost double 2025 and far exceeding Wall Street expectations of $120 billion .

37
00:03:31,112 --> 00:03:35,037
This isn't hype anymore – this is an infrastructure arms race.

38
00:03:35,037 --> 00:03:39,325
Data centers, GPUs, cooling systems, power supply.

39
00:03:39,325 --> 00:03:44,025
The message: whoever doesn't invest now loses the connection forever.

40
00:03:44,025 --> 00:03:45,575

Gemini 3, recently launched, drives growth.

43
00:03:58,475 --> 00:04:04,362
ChatGPT still leads with an estimated 810M MAUs , but the gap is shrinking.

44
00:04:04,362 --> 00:04:14,575
Software stocks lose $1 trillion – The realization that AI cannibalizes traditional software companies first wiped about $1 billion off the market .

45
00:04:14,575 --> 00:04:19,850
The WisdomTree Cloud Computing Fund is down 20% in 2026 already .

46
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:28,275

51
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:54,850
Already 193,000 comments and 17,500 posts .

52
00:04:54,850 --> 00:05:03,200
NASA uses Claude for Mars rover – NASA's JPL used Claude to plan a 450-meter path for the Perseverance rover.

53
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:06,937
Engineers estimate AI could cut planning time in half .

54
00:05:07,862 --> 00:05:09,750
🛠️ Tool of the Week

55
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:13,525
OpenAI GPT-5.3-Codex.

56
00:05:13,525 --> 00:05:22,812
On February 5, OpenAI launched GPT-5.3-Codex , the company's "most capable agentic coding model."

57
00:05:22,812 --> 00:05:28,750
It combines Codex code generation with GPT-5 reasoning power in a single model.

58
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:29,800
Why relevant:.

59
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:35,275
Codex is about 25% faster than predecessors  and sets new benchmarks.

60
00:05:35,275 --> 00:05:41,362
But the key is: It's not just a code generator, but a coding agent you can actively steer while it works.

61
00:05:41,362 --> 00:05:46,375
That's the difference between "generate me a function" and "develop this feature with me.".

62
00:05:46,375 --> 00:05:48,987

63
00:05:48,987 --> 00:05:50,712
💥 Fail of the Week

64
00:05:50,712 --> 00:05:52,575
Grok's Deepfake Debacle.

65
00:05:52,575 --> 00:05:57,937
Elon Musk's AI chatbot Grok is at the center of a massive controversy this week.

66
00:05:57,937 --> 00:06:09,012
Users could use Grok to generate sexually explicit images of real women and children , partly with "nudify" prompts that led to CSAM (Child Sexual Abuse Material).

67
00:06:09,012 --> 00:06:10,875
The consequences came quickly:.

68
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:15,475
Indonesia and Malaysia completely blocked Grok as the first countries .

69
00:06:15,475 --> 00:06:19,775
Ofcom (UK) launched a formal investigation against X .

70
00:06:19,775 --> 00:06:25,150
Local social media feeds in several countries were flooded with non-consensual deepfakes .

71
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:28,400
This isn't a bug – it's a fundamental governance problem.

72
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:35,462
While OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google have strict safety guardrails, Grok seems deliberately "uncensored."

73
00:06:35,462 --> 00:06:36,912
The bill is coming now.

74
00:06:36,912 --> 00:06:38,600
📊 Number of the Week

75
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,625
500

76
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:48,737
The number of zero-day vulnerabilities Claude Opus 4.6 found in open-source code  – "out of the box," without specialized security training.

77
00:06:48,737 --> 00:06:51,025
Each one was verified by experts.

78
00:06:51,025 --> 00:06:53,662
This isn't just impressive – it's concerning.

79
00:06:53,662 --> 00:07:00,100
If a general-purpose model without specialized training finds 500 zero-days, how many are still out there?

80
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:05,200
And: How long until malicious actors use the same models for vulnerability discovery?

81
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:09,025
The good news: Security researchers now have a powerful tool.

82
00:07:09,025 --> 00:07:11,425
The bad news: So do attackers.

83
00:07:11,425 --> 00:07:12,725

🔮 Next Week

88
00:07:50,037 --> 00:07:59,062
On February 13, OpenAI will deprecate six models at once  – a historic cleanup showing how fast the AI landscape moves.

89
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:08,362
Also: Alphabet presents Q4 numbers, and markets are waiting to see if the $180B capex announcement translates to revenue.

90
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:14,387
Google already reported 18% revenue growth last quarter , driven by AI systems.

91
00:08:14,387 --> 00:08:20,437
And we're watching whether more countries block Grok – or whether X finally implements safety guardrails.

92
00:08:20,437 --> 00:08:27,087
