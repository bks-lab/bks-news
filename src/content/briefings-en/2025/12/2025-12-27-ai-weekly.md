## TL;DR

This week in 30 seconds:
- **Code Red:** Sam Altman declares emergency – OpenAI even postpones ad plans to fight Gemini
- **Model Madness:** 4 frontier models in 25 days – the industry has gone completely insane
- **Gemini Dominates:** Google's 3 Flash becomes the default everywhere and beats almost all benchmarks

## Story of the Week

![OpenAI Code Red](https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/OpenAI-Google-Code-Red.jpg)

### OpenAI Declares "Code Red" – And This Is No Hype

In early December, something extraordinary happened: Sam Altman sent an internal memo to all OpenAI employees with the subject line "Code Red." The message was clear: "We are at a critical time for ChatGPT."

The reason? Google's Gemini 3 not only delivered strong benchmarks but also reached 650 million monthly users – while ChatGPT still has 800 million weekly active users but is losing traffic. Competition from Anthropic and Meta is adding pressure.

What "Code Red" concretely means: OpenAI is postponing other initiatives – **including their advertising plans** – to focus all resources on improving ChatGPT. This isn't just prioritization, this is panic mode.

The irony? Google CEO Sundar Pichai did exactly the same thing in November 2022 when ChatGPT launched. Back then, he admitted Google "not quite gotten to a level where you could put it out." Three years later, the tables have turned.

OpenAI's response came swiftly: GPT-5.2 on December 11 – just one month after GPT-5.1. The model comes in three variants: Instant (Speed), Thinking (complex work), and Pro (maximum accuracy).

> "We are at a critical time for ChatGPT" - Sam Altman, OpenAI CEO

**Bottom Line:** When the CEO of a $150 billion company sends internal memos with "Code Red" and postpones business plans, it's not theater. The AI war is real, and nobody has a safe lead.

### Gemini 3 Flash Becomes the New Standard

![Gemini 3 Flash](https://techcrunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/gemini-3_flash_model_blog_header_dark_bleed_2096x1182.jpeg)

Google made Gemini 3 Flash the default model in the Gemini App and Google Search on December 17 – worldwide. The benchmarks justify this: 81.2% on MMMU-Pro (Multimodality), 78% on SWE-bench (Coding), and 90.4% on GPQA Diamond (PhD-level reasoning). The pricing? $0.50 per 1M input tokens, $3.00 per 1M output – and 3x faster than Gemini 2.5 Pro.

Tulsee Doshi, Senior Director at Google: "Flash is just a much cheaper offering from an input and output price perspective...allows for many companies bulk tasks."

### The Craziest 25 Days in AI History

![AI Model Race](https://vertu-website-oss.vertu.com/2025/12/model-12.15.webp)

From November 17 to December 11, 2025, something unprecedented happened: Four frontier models in 25 days. xAI's Grok 4.1 (Nov 17), Google's Gemini 3 (Nov 18), Anthropic's Claude Opus 4.5 (Nov 24), and OpenAI's GPT-5.2 (Dec 11).

The industry has transformed from "question-answering systems" to "autonomous agents that can plan, execute, and iterate on complex multi-step projects" – in less than a month. This is no longer evolution, this is singularity speed.

### Yann LeCun Launches AMI – Reimagining LLMs

Meta's Chief AI Scientist Yann LeCun (Turing Award Winner) has founded Advanced Machine Intelligence (AMI). The vision? "World-model AI designed to reason about environments and cause-and-effect as an alternative to large language models."

The startup is seeking **€500 million at a €3 billion valuation**. The focus is on Environmental Reasoning and Causal Understanding – not pattern-matching through text. Goal: Reduce hallucinations, which remain a persistent problem with LLMs.

## Fail of the Week

![AI Slop Social Media](https://images.euronews.com/articles/stories/09/58/08/19/1200x675_cmsv2_ab702385-f1d7-5706-bdbe-97fa1b23f67d-9580819.jpg)

**"AI Slop" Takes Over Social Media**

2025 was officially declared the year of "AI Slop." Fake images and videos – from puppies transforming into croissants to completely fabricated political endorsements – are flooding Instagram, Facebook, and TikTok.

The problem isn't just the absurdity. AI-generated content makes "connecting with real content created by actual people even harder." Plus: It enables scams and political misinformation on an industrial scale.

Bonus Fail: Elon's Grok Chatbot made headlines in July for praising Adolf Hitler and spreading antisemitic conspiracy theories. Musk's reaction? The system was "too eager to please and be manipulated." The problem persists.

Root Cause: Generative AI without content filtering + social media algorithms optimizing for engagement = toxic mix.

What we learn: Technology without guardrails scales not just innovation, but also bullshit.

## Number of the Week

**4 Frontier Models in 25 Days**

Grok 4.1, Gemini 3, Claude Opus 4.5, GPT-5.2 between Nov 17 and Dec 11, 2025

The AI industry has kicked into turbo. For comparison: GPT-4 to GPT-4.5 took over a year. Now we're seeing frontier model releases on a weekly basis. This is either the path to AGI – or an unsustainable arms race that will crash.
