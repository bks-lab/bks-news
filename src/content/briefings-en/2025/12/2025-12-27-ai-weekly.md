## TL;DR

This week in 30 seconds:
- **Code Red:** Sam Altman declares emergency status – OpenAI even postpones advertising plans to compete against Gemini
- **Model madness:** 4 frontier models in 25 days – the industry is completely accelerating
- **Gemini dominates:** Google's 3 Flash becomes the default everywhere and beats nearly all benchmarks

## The Story of the Week


### OpenAI declares "Code Red" – and this is no hype

In early December, something extraordinary happened: Sam Altman sent an internal memo to all OpenAI employees with the subject "Code Red". The message was clear: "We are at a critical time for ChatGPT."

Why? Google's Gemini 3 didn't just deliver strong benchmarks – it reached 650 million monthly active users, while ChatGPT still has 800 million weekly active users but is losing traffic. Competition from Anthropic and Meta adds additional pressure.

What "Code Red" concretely means: OpenAI is postponing other initiatives – **including their advertising plans** – to concentrate all resources on improving ChatGPT. This isn't just prioritization, this is panic mode.

The irony? Google CEO Sundar Pichai did exactly the same thing in November 2022 when ChatGPT launched. Back then, he admitted that Google had "not quite gotten to a level where you could put it out." Three years later, the game has turned.

OpenAI's response came quickly: GPT-5.2 on December 11 – just one month after GPT-5.1. The model comes in three variants: Instant (speed), Thinking (complex work), and Pro (maximum accuracy).

> "We are at a critical time for ChatGPT" - Sam Altman, OpenAI CEO

**Bottom Line:** When the CEO of a $150 billion company sends internal memos with "Code Red" and postpones business plans, that's not theater. The AI war is real, and nobody has a safe advantage.

## Other Top Stories

### Gemini 3 Flash becomes the new standard


On December 17, Google made Gemini 3 Flash the default model in the Gemini App and Google Search – worldwide. The benchmarks justify it: 81.2% on MMMU-Pro (multimodality), 78% on SWE-bench (coding), and 90.4% on GPQA Diamond (PhD-level reasoning). The pricing? $0.50 per 1M input tokens, $3.00 per 1M output tokens – and 3x faster than Gemini 2.5 Pro.

Tulsee Doshi, Senior Director at Google: "Flash is just a much cheaper offering from an input and output price perspective...allows for many companies bulk tasks."

### The craziest 25 days in AI history


From November 17 to December 11, 2025, something unprecedented happened: four frontier models within 25 days. xAI's Grok 4.1 (November 17), Google's Gemini 3 (November 18), Anthropic's Claude Opus 4.5 (November 24), and OpenAI's GPT-5.2 (December 11).

The industry has transformed from "question-answering systems" to "autonomous agents that can plan, execute, and iterate on complex multi-step projects" – in less than a month. This is no longer evolution, this is singularity-speed.

### Nvidia acquires Groq for $20 billion – biggest deal ever


On Christmas Eve, Nvidia announced the largest acquisition in the company's history: **$20 billion in cash** for Groq, the AI chip challenger specializing in low-latency inference.

Groq was founded in 2016 by Google TPU co-inventor Jonathan Ross and had a $6.9B valuation in September 2024 after a $750M funding round. Their LPUs (Language Processing Units) are optimized for inference – not training – and deliver extremely predictable latency.

**What Nvidia gets:**
- Groq's entire IP and team (Ross will join Nvidia)
- Specialized inference chips for real-time AI
- 2+ million developers using GroqCloud

**What Nvidia does NOT get:** GroqCloud itself remains independent and continues operating.

> "We plan to integrate Groq's low-latency processors into the NVIDIA AI factory architecture." - Jensen Huang, Nvidia CEO

**Critical voice:** Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon: "Structuring as non-exclusive license may keep the fiction of competition alive" – the deal could raise antitrust concerns.

### Yann LeCun launches AMI – and wants to rethink LLMs

Meta's Chief AI Scientist Yann LeCun (Turing Award winner) has founded Advanced Machine Intelligence (AMI). The vision? "World-model AI designed to reason about environments and cause-and-effect as an alternative to large language models."

The startup is seeking **€500 million at a €3 billion valuation**. The focus is on environmental reasoning and causal understanding – not pattern-matching through text. Goal: reduce hallucinations, which remain a persistent problem in LLMs.

## Fail of the Week


**"AI Slop" takes over social media**

2025 was officially declared the year of "AI Slop". Fake images and videos – from puppies transforming into croissants to completely fabricated political endorsements – are flooding Instagram, Facebook, and TikTok.

The problem isn't just the absurdity. AI-generated content makes "connecting with real content created by actual people even harder." Plus: it enables scams and political misinformation at industrial scale.

Bonus-fail: Elon's Grok chatbot made headlines in July because it praised Adolf Hitler and spread antisemitic conspiracy theories. Musk's response? The system was "too eager to please and be manipulated." The problem persists.

Root cause: Generative AI without content filtering + social media algorithms optimizing for engagement = toxic mix.

What we learn: Technology without guardrails scales not just innovation, but also bullshit.

---

## Number of the Week

**$20 billion**

Nvidia's biggest deal ever – for Groq's inference chips

The message: Training is solved, now it's about inference. Nvidia secures the best low-latency technology on the market. For comparison: the previous record was Mellanox in 2019 for $7B. This deal is almost 3x larger – and shows where the next AI battle will be fought.
