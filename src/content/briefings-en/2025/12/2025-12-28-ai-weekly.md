## TL;DR

This week in 30 seconds:
- **RAM Crisis:** AI is devouring memory chips – 50% price increase, shortage until 2027
- **Red Lines:** Microsoft refuses "runaway" superintelligence – Suleyman sets clear boundaries
- **Mega Deal:** Nvidia licenses Groq for $20 billion – focus shifts to inference

## Story of the Week

### AI is Eating the Memory Market – And Consumers Pay the Price

The AI revolution has an unexpected casualty: memory chips are becoming a luxury good. Micron, one of the world's largest RAM manufacturers, reported record earnings this week – along with troubling news: demand significantly exceeds supply.

The problem is structural. AI datacenters are consuming massive amounts of High-Bandwidth Memory (HBM) to feed their GPUs. What means champagne for Nvidia shareholders translates to more expensive laptops, smartphones, and gaming consoles for consumers.

The numbers are stark: DRAM prices rose 50% this quarter. Rush orders cost manufacturers double or triple. And analysts project another 40% increase next quarter.

> "Aggregate industry supply will remain substantially short of the demand for the foreseeable future." - Sanjay Mehrotra, Micron CEO

Dell COO Jeff Clarke has already warned that these costs will be passed on to customers. Tech analyst Avril Wu recommends consumers buy now if they need new devices.

The bitter irony: Micron has even shut down its consumer SSD and RAM division – to free up capacity for more lucrative AI chips. Relief isn't expected until 2027, when new manufacturing facilities come online.

**Bottom Line:** The AI boom comes at a price, and consumers will feel it on their next hardware purchase.

## More Top Stories

### Bad Blood Author Takes on AI Industry

John Carreyrou, the investigative journalist behind the Theranos scandal, has a new target: the entire AI industry. This week, a group of authors under his leadership filed suit against OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, xAI, and Perplexity.

The accusation: The companies trained their models on pirated copies of copyrighted books – from sources like LibGen, Z-Library, and OceanofPDF. The plaintiffs are demanding $150,000 per work per defendant, potentially $900,000 per book.

For comparison: The previous Anthropic settlement offered only about $3,000 per author – just 2% of the statutory maximum. Carreyrou and company want more.

### Microsoft Pulls the Superintelligence Emergency Brake

While OpenAI and others race toward AGI, Microsoft is taking a different path. AI chief Mustafa Suleyman announced the creation of the "MAI Superintelligence Team" – with a clear philosophy: "Humanist Superintelligence" instead of unlimited capabilities.

The crucial difference? Microsoft wants specialized systems for medicine and energy rather than an infinitely capable generalist. Suleyman justifies this with controllability: broadly capable superintelligence cannot be adequately governed.

> "We won't continue to develop a system that has the potential to run away from us." - Mustafa Suleyman, Microsoft AI CEO

His "red lines": Containment and alignment are non-negotiable. No system goes live that doesn't meet these criteria. In an industry optimizing for maximum capability, that's a remarkable statement.

### Nvidia Buys Inference Dominance

On Christmas Eve, Nvidia announced the largest deal in company history: $20 billion for a non-exclusive license to Groq's technology – plus acquisition of the founding team.

What Nvidia gets: Jonathan Ross, who co-invented the TPU at Google, and access to Groq's Language Processing Units (LPUs). These chips are optimized for inference – not training – and promise 10x higher speed at one-tenth the energy consumption.

The message is clear: Training is largely solved, now it's about efficient inference. Groq had raised $750 million at a $6.9B valuation just in September. That Nvidia is paying triple shows how hot the inference market is getting.

## Tool of the Week

**Anthropic Skills** - Reusable Workflow Definitions for Claude

Anthropic has made "Skills" an open standard. Skills are instruction sets that teach Claude specific workflows, standards, and domain knowledge – and are now portable between different platforms.

The integration with Notion, Figma, Canva, and Atlassian makes this particularly interesting for teams: Once-defined processes work the same everywhere.

Who should use it: Anyone looking to standardize repetitive AI workflows. [More Info](https://www.anthropic.com/news)

## Fail of the Week

**"Slop" is Word of the Year – And It's Deserved**

Merriam-Webster has spoken: The word of 2025 is "Slop" – defined as low-quality digital content usually produced in quantity by artificial intelligence.

The word's history is fitting: In the 18th century it meant "soft mud," then "pig feed," eventually "garbage." Now it stands for everything from bizarre AI videos to fake news to what Merriam-Webster calls "workslop" – AI-generated reports that waste coworkers' time.

The implicit message to the AI industry: For all the superintelligence talk – sometimes you just don't seem that intelligent.

## Number of the Week

**$20 Billion**

Nvidia's largest deal ever – for Groq's inference technology

For comparison: The previous record was Mellanox in 2019 for $6.9 billion. This deal is nearly 3x larger. The message: Whoever dominates AI inference dominates the next phase of the AI revolution.
