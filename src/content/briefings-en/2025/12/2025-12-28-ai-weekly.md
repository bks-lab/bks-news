## TL;DR

This week in 30 seconds:
- **RAM Crisis:** AI is devouring memory chips – 50% price increase, shortage until 2027
- **Red Lines:** Microsoft refuses "runaway" superintelligence – Suleyman sets clear boundaries
- **Mega Deal:** Nvidia licenses Groq for $20 billion – focus shifts to inference

## Story of the Week

### AI is Eating the Memory Market – And Consumers Pay the Price

The AI revolution has an unexpected casualty: memory chips are becoming a luxury good. [[1]](#source-1) Micron, one of the world's largest RAM manufacturers, reported record earnings this week – along with troubling news: demand significantly exceeds supply. [[1]](#source-1)

The problem is structural. AI datacenters are consuming massive amounts of High-Bandwidth Memory (HBM) to feed their GPUs. [[1]](#source-1) What means champagne for Nvidia shareholders translates to more expensive laptops, smartphones, and gaming consoles for consumers.

The numbers are stark: DRAM prices rose 50% this quarter. [[1]](#source-1) Rush orders cost manufacturers double or triple. And analysts project another 40% increase next quarter. [[1]](#source-1)

> "Aggregate industry supply will remain substantially short of the demand for the foreseeable future." - Sanjay Mehrotra, Micron CEO [[1]](#source-1)

Dell COO Jeff Clarke has already warned that these costs will be passed on to customers. [[1]](#source-1) Tech analyst Avril Wu recommends consumers buy now if they need new devices. [[1]](#source-1)

The bitter irony: Micron has even shut down its consumer SSD and RAM division – to free up capacity for more lucrative AI chips. [[1]](#source-1) Relief isn't expected until 2027, when new manufacturing facilities come online. [[1]](#source-1)

**Bottom Line:** The AI boom comes at a price, and consumers will feel it on their next hardware purchase.

## More Top Stories

### Bad Blood Author Takes on AI Industry

John Carreyrou, the investigative journalist behind the Theranos scandal, has a new target: the entire AI industry. [[2]](#source-2) This week, a group of authors under his leadership filed suit against OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, xAI, and Perplexity. [[2]](#source-2)

The accusation: The companies trained their models on pirated copies of copyrighted books – from sources like LibGen, Z-Library, and OceanofPDF. [[2]](#source-2) The plaintiffs are demanding $150,000 per work per defendant, potentially $900,000 per book. [[2]](#source-2)

For comparison: The previous Anthropic settlement offered only about $3,000 per author – just 2% of the statutory maximum. [[2]](#source-2) Carreyrou and company want more.

### Microsoft Pulls the Superintelligence Emergency Brake

While OpenAI and others race toward AGI, Microsoft is taking a different path. [[3]](#source-3) AI chief Mustafa Suleyman announced the creation of the "MAI Superintelligence Team" – with a clear philosophy: "Humanist Superintelligence" instead of unlimited capabilities. [[3]](#source-3)

The crucial difference? Microsoft wants specialized systems for medicine and energy rather than an infinitely capable generalist. [[3]](#source-3) Suleyman justifies this with controllability: broadly capable superintelligence cannot be adequately governed. [[3]](#source-3)

> "We won't continue to develop a system that has the potential to run away from us." - Mustafa Suleyman, Microsoft AI CEO [[3]](#source-3)

His "red lines": Containment and alignment are non-negotiable. No system goes live that doesn't meet these criteria. [[3]](#source-3) In an industry optimizing for maximum capability, that's a remarkable statement.

### Nvidia Buys Inference Dominance

On Christmas Eve, Nvidia announced the largest deal in company history: $20 billion for a non-exclusive license to Groq's technology – plus acquisition of the founding team. [[4]](#source-4)

What Nvidia gets: Jonathan Ross, who co-invented the TPU at Google, and access to Groq's Language Processing Units (LPUs). [[4]](#source-4) These chips are optimized for inference – not training – and promise 10x higher speed at one-tenth the energy consumption. [[4]](#source-4)

The message is clear: Training is largely solved, now it's about efficient inference. [[4]](#source-4) Groq had raised $750 million at a $6.9B valuation just in September. [[4]](#source-4) That Nvidia is paying triple shows how hot the inference market is getting.

## Tool of the Week

**Anthropic Skills** - Reusable Workflow Definitions for Claude

Anthropic has made "Skills" an open standard. Skills are instruction sets that teach Claude specific workflows, standards, and domain knowledge – and are now portable between different platforms.

The integration with Notion, Figma, Canva, and Atlassian makes this particularly interesting for teams: Once-defined processes work the same everywhere.

Who should use it: Anyone looking to standardize repetitive AI workflows. [More Info](https://www.anthropic.com/news)

## Fail of the Week

**"Slop" is Word of the Year – And It's Deserved**

Merriam-Webster has spoken: The word of 2025 is "Slop" – defined as low-quality digital content usually produced in quantity by artificial intelligence. [[5]](#source-5)

The word's history is fitting: In the 18th century it meant "soft mud," then "pig feed," eventually "garbage." [[5]](#source-5) Now it stands for everything from bizarre AI videos to fake news to what Merriam-Webster calls "workslop" – AI-generated reports that waste coworkers' time. [[5]](#source-5)

The implicit message to the AI industry: For all the superintelligence talk – sometimes you just don't seem that intelligent.

## Number of the Week

**$20 Billion**

Nvidia's largest deal ever – for Groq's inference technology [[4]](#source-4)

For comparison: The previous record was Mellanox in 2019 for $6.9 billion. This deal is nearly 3x larger. [[4]](#source-4) The message: Whoever dominates AI inference dominates the next phase of the AI revolution.
