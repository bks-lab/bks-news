## The Story of the Week


### MCP Becomes Universal Standard – and the Entire Industry is Joining In

On December 9, 2025, something historic happened for the AI industry: Anthropic donated the Model Context Protocol (MCP) to the Linux Foundation. But that was just the beginning.

The newly established **Agentic AI Foundation (AAIF)** unites the industry's biggest competitors for the first time: Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, AWS, Cloudflare, and Bloomberg as Platinum members. Three projects form the foundation:

1. **MCP (Anthropic):** The universal standard for AI tool integration – over 10,000 published MCP servers ranging from developer tools to Fortune 500 deployments
2. **AGENTS.md (OpenAI):** Already adopted by 60,000+ open-source projects, including Cursor, Devin, GitHub Copilot, Gemini CLI
3. **Goose (Block):** Open-source agent framework for local, trustworthy AI workflows

> "We are seeing AI enter a new phase, as conversational systems shift to autonomous agents that can work together." - Jim Zemlin, Executive Director, Linux Foundation

The timing is no accident: the shift from chat to agents requires interoperability. If your Claude agent needs to talk to a GPT tool and a Gemini service, you need standards. MCP delivers exactly that.

**What changes for developers:** Nothing dramatic – existing maintainers retain technical control. But now vendor neutrality is guaranteed. MCP belongs to no one and to everyone simultaneously.

**Bottom Line:** The AI industry has learned: standards win over walled gardens. Anyone building MCP servers now is building for the entire ecosystem, not just one vendor.

## Other Top Stories

### GPT-5.2: OpenAI's Response to Code Red


Just 10 days after the internal "Code Red" memo, OpenAI delivered GPT-5.2 on December 11 – along with the specialized GPT-5.2 Codex for software engineering.

**Three Variants:**
- **Instant:** Speed-optimized for routine queries
- **Thinking:** For complex work like coding, long documents, math
- **Pro:** Maximum accuracy for enterprise-critical tasks

**The Numbers:**
- 400K context window (2.5x GPT-5.1)
- 93.2% on GPQA Diamond (PhD-level Q&A)
- 80.0% on SWE-bench Verified (just slightly behind Claude Opus 4.5's 80.9%)
- 100% on AIME 2025 without tools
- 38% fewer errors than predecessor

Pricing: $1.75 input / $14 output per 1M tokens – more expensive than Gemini 3 Flash, but with more capabilities.

**Reality Check:** The benchmarks are impressive, but this doesn't solve OpenAI's growth problem. Gemini continues growing faster, and Claude dominates enterprise coding.

### Disney Opens 200+ Characters for Sora


The month's most surprising partnership: Disney and OpenAI are allowing users to generate videos featuring over 200 Disney characters via Sora – from Mickey Mouse to Marvel heroes.

This is a radical shift for Disney, which has traditionally guarded its IP like treasure. The deal shows: even the most conservative content owners recognize that AI-generated content is inevitable. Better to participate in a controlled way than to be left behind.

### Trump's AI Executive Order: Federal vs. State


On December 11, President Trump signed the Executive Order "Ensuring a National Policy Framework for Artificial Intelligence". The core message: **Federal law should override State laws.**

**What the Order Actually Does:**
- AI Litigation Task Force: To review State AI laws for constitutional compliance within 30 days
- Commerce Department: 90 days to identify "onerous" State laws
- Funding Pressure: States with "problematic" AI laws lose broadband funding

**The Exceptions:** Child safety, AI infrastructure, and government procurement remain state matters.

**Industry Reaction:** Mixed. Big Tech welcomes standardization, but 24 State Attorneys General have already filed protests – citing violations of the 10th Amendment and dormant commerce clause arguments. The tension between innovation and consumer protection remains unresolved.

**Critical Voices:** Consumer advocacy groups (EFF, NCLC) warn that the order could endanger important consumer protection laws in California (privacy) and Massachusetts (transparency).

## Tool of the Week


**Gemini Deep Research** - PhD-Level Research on Demand

Google's newly redesigned research agent is based on Gemini 3 Pro and is now available to developers via the Interactions API. The tool:

- Systematically searches sources (web, papers, docs)
- Synthesizes findings into structured reports
- Delivers PhD-level insights with source attribution

The game changer: you can now embed Deep Research directly in your own apps. Instead of manually writing prompts, you call an API and get research reports back.

## Fail of the Week


**1,000+ AI Laws in 47 States – and No Overview**

Over **1,000 AI-related bills** were introduced across US states in 2025. In healthcare alone: 250+ bills in 47 states. The problem: no company can be compliant when every state makes its own rules.

The Trump Executive Order responds to this – but with a sledgehammer instead of consensus. The result: legal uncertainty for years as courts determine constitutionality.

**Root Cause:** AI regulation became a campaign issue before technical standards existed.

**What We Learn:** Fragmented regulation is just as harmful as no regulation. The industry should have pushed for self-imposed standards earlier.

## Number of the Week

**10,000+ MCP Servers**

Number of published Model Context Protocol servers – ranging from developer tools to Fortune 500 deployments

A year after launch, MCP has become the de facto standard for AI tool integration. The Linux Foundation donation now secures its future. For comparison: REST APIs took 5+ years to achieve similar adoption.
