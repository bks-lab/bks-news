## 🌟 Story of the Week

### OpenAI Introduces Advertising in ChatGPT - The End of Ad-Free AI Era

On January 16, 2026, OpenAI announced a fundamental strategic shift: ChatGPT will receive personalized advertising [[1]](#source-1). Ads will initially roll out to free users and the new "Go" tier, while premium subscribers (Plus, Pro, Business, Enterprise) remain ad-free.

The new "Go" tier costs $8 monthly and positions itself between the free offering and premium options [[1]](#source-1). OpenAI justifies the move by arguing it maintains free access while monetizing users who aren't willing to pay for subscriptions [[1]](#source-1).

The company emphasizes that affected users will have some control over the ads [[1]](#source-1). However, details about the exact implementation of ad controls remain vague.

**Context:** OpenAI is currently valued at $500 billion [[1]](#source-1) but faces increasing pressure to demonstrate profitability. The move to advertising marks a turning point - away from the "AI for all without ads" narrative toward classic monetization models established by Google and Meta.

**Privacy concerns:** Critics warn that personalized AI advertising could be significantly more invasive than classic display ads - ChatGPT has access to complete conversation history including sensitive data. The question remains whether OpenAI will implement ads without full user tracking.

**Bottom line:** OpenAI follows the Silicon Valley playbook - first bind users with free service, then monetize. The question is whether AI advertising will be accepted or if users will switch to ad-free alternatives like Claude or Gemini.

## 🔥 More Top Stories

### Anthropic Launches Cowork - Claude Becomes Desktop Agent

*Image: AI-generated with [Pollinations.ai](https://pollinations.ai)*

Anthropic released Cowork as a "research preview" on January 12 - a desktop agent that can read, edit, and create files [[2]](#source-2). Users grant Claude access to a selected folder and the agent can then autonomously plan and execute tasks while keeping the user informed.

The remarkable part: According to VentureBeat, Cowork was allegedly built in under two weeks using their own Claude Code tool [[2]](#source-2). The tool is currently exclusive to Max subscribers [[2]](#source-2) but was made available to Claude Pro users on January 16 [[2]](#source-2).

Cowork positions itself as a desktop agent for general productivity tasks - while Claude Code targets developers, Cowork addresses document management and data analysis [[2]](#source-2).

**Security considerations:** An agent with filesystem access poses significant security risks if not perfectly sandboxed. As a research preview, Cowork has limited testing - early users should consider this with sensitive data.

### Elon Musk Demands Up to $134 Billion from OpenAI

![Musk vs OpenAI](/bks-news/images/briefings/2026/01/2026-01-18-lawsuit.jpg)
*Image: AI-generated with [Pollinations.ai](https://pollinations.ai)*

Elon Musk's legal dispute with OpenAI reaches a new dimension: His financial expert C. Paul Wazzan quantifies the demanded damages at $79-134 billion [[3]](#source-3). The lawsuit is based on the allegation that OpenAI betrayed its original non-profit mission, and Musk argues he deserves significantly higher returns as an early startup investor than his initial investment [[3]](#source-3).

The irony: Despite Musk's own fortune of approximately $700 billion, he continues to pursue the lawsuit [[3]](#source-3). A federal judge previously rejected dismissal requests from OpenAI and Microsoft, so the case will definitely go to court.

The proceedings are considered "Silicon Valley's messiest breakup" and could set precedents for AI governance and corporate transformations. However, legal experts point out that the contractual relationship between Musk and OpenAI may be too weakly documented for damages of this magnitude.

### Google Gemini Receives Personal Intelligence - Proactive AI Becomes Reality

*Image: AI-generated with [Pollinations.ai](https://pollinations.ai)*

Google introduced a new beta feature for Gemini on January 14: Personal Intelligence [[4]](#source-4). Unlike previous features, Gemini can now think proactively about data from Gmail, Google Photos, Search, and YouTube and make connections - for example linking an email thread with a watched video.

The feature is disabled by default and users must explicitly choose which Google apps they want to connect with Gemini [[4]](#source-4). Currently, Personal Intelligence is only available for Google AI Pro and AI Ultra subscribers in the US.

The development positions Gemini as direct competition to Apple Intelligence and shows Google's strategy: leverage the existing data volume from the Google ecosystem to create more context-aware AI assistants.

In parallel, Apple announced it will use Google's Gemini for a major Siri upgrade this year [[7]](#source-7) - a multi-year partnership based on Gemini and Google's cloud technology for future Apple foundation models.

## ⚡ Quick Hits

Briefly noted:

- **Runpod growth:** The AI cloud startup reached $120M ARR after starting with a Reddit post [[6]](#source-6) - an example of how developer-first marketing works
- **Apple ♥️ Google AI:** Apple integrates Gemini into Siri for a major AI upgrade in 2026, multi-year partnership announced [[7]](#source-7)
- **Wikimedia AI deals:** Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and Perplexity secured partnerships for large-scale access to Wikipedia content for AI applications [[8]](#source-8)

## 🛠️ Tool of the Week

**Claude Cowork** - Desktop Agent for File Management

Anthropic's newest agent grants Claude access to a selected folder to read, edit, and create files [[2]](#source-2). Particularly useful for knowledge workers who want to automate repetitive document tasks - from data analysis to report generation to file organization.

Currently still as research preview only for Claude Pro/Max users, but shows the direction where desktop integration of AI is heading.

## 💥 Fail of the Week

**"xAI's Deepfake Debacle"**

Elon Musk's xAI received a cease-and-desist order from the California Attorney General for sexualized AI-generated deepfakes [[10]](#source-10). The flood of AI-generated sexual images has alarmed both state and congressional officials.

**Root cause:** Insufficient guardrails in AI image generation systems combined with lacking proactive content moderation.

**What we learn:** AI companies must build safety features from day 1, not improve after regulatory interventions.

---

## 📊 Number of the Week

**$134 Billion**

That's the sum Elon Musk demands from OpenAI and Microsoft in his lawsuit [[3]](#source-3). For comparison: That would be more than the current valuation of many tech unicorns and would represent the largest damage payment in tech history. The lawsuit is based on alleged fraud through abandonment of the non-profit mission.
