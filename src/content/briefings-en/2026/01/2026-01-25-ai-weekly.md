## Story of the Week

### Apple and Google Forge Historic AI Pact

On January 12, Apple and Google announced a partnership that sent shockwaves through the tech world: Google's Gemini will power Apple's Siri and Apple Intelligence going forward [[1]](#source-1). The deal is estimated at one billion dollars per year [[2]](#source-2).

After careful evaluation, Apple determined that Google's AI technology provides the most capable foundation for Apple Foundation Models [[1]](#source-1). The enhanced Siri is expected to arrive with iOS 26.4 in March or April, bringing better contextual understanding, screen awareness, and deeper app integration [[2]](#source-2).

The deal is non-exclusive - Apple's existing ChatGPT integration remains for now [[1]](#source-1). Yet the message is clear: in the AI race, Apple is betting on Google rather than developing its own models.

**Critical perspective:** For Google, this is an enormous validation win. For Apple, it's an admission that their own AI development couldn't keep pace with competitors. Users benefit from a potentially much smarter Siri - but must accept that their data now flows through Google's cloud as well.

**Bottom Line:** The biggest AI deal of the year shows that even tech giants can't build everything themselves. The AI future belongs to partnerships.

## More Top Stories

### Disney Opens Its Universe to AI-Generated Videos

The Walt Disney Company and OpenAI have struck a three-year deal giving Sora access to over 200 animated characters - from Mickey and Minnie to Elsa to Star Wars figures [[3]](#source-3). Disney is investing one billion dollars in OpenAI and receiving warrants for additional equity [[3]](#source-3).

Starting early 2026, users can create short videos with Disney characters. The generated content will also be showcased in curated selections on Disney+ [[3]](#source-3). Real actor voices and likenesses are excluded.

**Critical perspective:** The deal cuts both ways. On one hand, it democratizes creative tools. On the other, a flood of AI-generated Disney content could dilute the brand and put pressure on human creators.

### Anthropic Acknowledges Possible AI Consciousness

*Image: AI-generated with [Pollinations.ai](https://pollinations.ai)*

In a fundamental overhaul of Claude's "constitution," Anthropic has taken a step no other AI lab has dared: the company acknowledges uncertainty about whether Claude might possess some kind of consciousness or moral status [[4]](#source-4).

The new constitution focuses on having Claude understand the reasoning behind behavioral rules - not just follow the rules themselves [[4]](#source-4). Anthropic is the only major AI lab with an internal "Model Welfare Team" investigating whether advanced AI systems could be conscious [[4]](#source-4).

The positioning is paying off: Anthropic now holds 32% of the enterprise LLM market by usage - ahead of OpenAI's 25% [[4]](#source-4).

**Bottom Line:** While other labs treat AI as pure tooling, Anthropic ventures into philosophical territory. This might be marketing - or the beginning of a serious debate about AI rights.

### IMF Chief Warns: AI Hitting Labor Market Like a Tsunami

At Davos, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva painted a stark picture: 60% of all jobs in advanced economies will be affected by AI - through enhancement, transformation, or elimination [[5]](#source-5). Globally, the figure is 40% [[5]](#source-5).

Particularly alarming: the middle class is getting squeezed while top earners benefit from AI and manual labor remains in demand [[5]](#source-5). Entry-level positions are disappearing rapidly, making it harder for young people to enter the workforce [[5]](#source-5).

Georgieva's message was clear: the world is not prepared, and technology is moving faster than regulators can follow [[5]](#source-5).

## Quick Hits

In brief:

- **Claude Code goes viral:** Jensen Huang calls Anthropic's coding tool "incredible" and urges companies to adopt it. A Google engineer reports it recreated a year's work in an hour [[6]](#source-6)
- **Davos AI clash:** DeepMind CEO Hassabis, Anthropic CEO Amodei, and Meta researcher LeCun publicly disagree about the timeline to human-level AI [[7]](#source-7)
- **Legal AI consolidation:** Harvey acquires Hexus - the market for legal AI tools is heating up [[10]](#source-10)
- **Voice AI unicorn:** LiveKit reaches $1B valuation as OpenAI partner for real-time voice AI [[9]](#source-9)
- **Anthropic in India:** The AI lab opens an office in Bengaluru and appoints Irina Ghose as Managing Director India [[4]](#source-4)

## Tool of the Week

**Claude Code** - The Unexpected Star

What started as a developer tool for programmers has become a phenomenon [[6]](#source-6). Users with zero programming experience now use Claude Code for tax filings, theater bookings, and even monitoring tomato plants [[6]](#source-6).

Adoption is exploding: Claude's total audience has more than doubled since December 2024 [[6]](#source-6). Enterprise customers like Uber, Netflix, Spotify, and Salesforce are on board [[6]](#source-6).

## Fail of the Week

**"The Fine Print Changed"**

Anthropic caused an uproar when developers suddenly encountered drastically reduced usage limits for Claude Code [[8]](#source-8). Complaints piled up in Anthropic's Discord channel about rapid token consumption [[8]](#source-8).

Anthropic's explanation: a holiday bonus had expired. Developers saw it differently - many felt blindsided by changes without clear communication.

**Root Cause:** Lack of transparency around pricing changes in a market built on trust.

**What we learn:** Even with AI services, customers hate surprises about costs.

---

## Number of the Week

**$1 Billion**

The amount Apple will reportedly pay Google annually for Gemini access [[1]](#source-1). For comparison, Google already pays Apple an estimated $20 billion per year to be the default search engine on iPhones. The relationship between the two giants grows ever more intertwined.
