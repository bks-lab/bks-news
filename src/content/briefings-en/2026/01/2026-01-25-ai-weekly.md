### IMF Chief: AI "Tsunami" Hits Labor Market - 40% of All Jobs Affected

Kristalina Georgieva, Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund, delivered a stark warning at the World Economic Forum in Davos. In a speech on January 23, she described AI's impact on the labor market as a "tsunami" [[1]](#source-1).

The numbers are alarming: In advanced economies, 60% of all jobs will be affected by AI - either enhanced, eliminated, or significantly transformed [[1]](#source-1). Globally, this figure stands at 40% [[8]](#source-8).

> "Wake up. AI is for real, and it is transforming our world faster than we are getting a handle on."

— Kristalina Georgieva, IMF Managing Director [[1]](#source-1)

According to Georgieva, entry-level workers and the middle class face the greatest risks. Entry-level positions that traditionally provided career starts for young workers would be eliminated first [[1]](#source-1). The IMF chief described unregulated, market-driven AI deployment as her "biggest worry," adding: "Even in the best prepared countries, I don't think we are prepared enough" [[8]](#source-8).

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink echoed the warning: "If AI does to white-collar workers what globalization did to blue-collar workers, we need to confront that reality directly" [[8]](#source-8).

## More Top Stories

*Image: AI-generated with [Pollinations.ai](https://pollinations.ai)*

Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis expressed surprise that OpenAI is already introducing ads into ChatGPT [[2]](#source-2). In an interview with Axios during the Davos Forum, he said:

> "I'm a little bit surprised they've moved so early into that. Ads, there's nothing wrong with ads... But in the realm of assistants, there is a question about how ads fit into that model. You want to have trust in your assistant."

— Demis Hassabis, Google DeepMind CEO [[7]](#source-7)

Google has no current plans for ads in Gemini and will monitor competitor user reactions [[2]](#source-2). Hassabis suggested OpenAI may be under financial pressure: "It's interesting they've gone for that so early. Maybe they feel they need to make more revenue" [[7]](#source-7).

### 2. Claude Code Conquers Enterprise - Microsoft Uses Competitor Tool

Anthropic's Claude Code has experienced a remarkable enterprise boom. The AI coding tool is now used by Uber, Netflix, Spotify, Salesforce, Accenture, and Snowflake [[3]](#source-3).

Particularly notable: Even at Microsoft, which sells competitor GitHub Copilot, Claude Code is widely used internally [[3]](#source-3). NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang called the tool "incredible" and urged companies to adopt it [[3]](#source-3).

Boris Cherny, Head of Claude Code at Anthropic, reported that a Google engineer replicated a year's worth of work in one hour using the tool [[3]](#source-3). Unlike earlier AI tools that merely suggest actions, Claude Code acts autonomously - it can edit files, control browsers, and manipulate applications [[3]](#source-3).

## Quick Hits

- **Sequoia Breaks VC Taboo**: The venture capital giant is investing in Anthropic despite already backing OpenAI and xAI - breaking the tradition of not funding competitors [[4]](#source-4)

- **OpenAI Protects Minors**: A new age prediction model will identify users under 18 and automatically apply protections to reduce exposure to sensitive content [[6]](#source-6)

- **Davos 2026 in AI Fever**: The World Economic Forum was dominated by tech CEOs like Musk, Nadella, Huang, and Hassabis - AI was the defining topic [[5]](#source-5)

- **AAAI-26 in Singapore**: The 40th AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence runs January 22-25 with a focus on "AI for Social Impact"

- **Elon Musk Predicts**: Tesla's robotaxis will be "very, very widespread" in the US by end of 2026, AGI could arrive this year [[5]](#source-5)

---

## Tool of the Week

**Claude Code** - Anthropic's AI coding agent that lives directly in your terminal and autonomously writes code, debugs, and handles Git workflows. Unlike tools like Cursor or GitHub Copilot, Claude Code can understand entire codebases and work independently on complex tasks for hours [[3]](#source-3).

**Why it matters:** The enterprise breakthrough at Microsoft, Netflix, and Uber shows AI-assisted coding is going mainstream - even at companies selling competing products.

---

## Fail of the Week

**OpenAI's Ad Rush** - Just two years after CEO Sam Altman called advertising a "last resort," OpenAI is already introducing ads into ChatGPT [[7]](#source-7). DeepMind CEO Hassabis criticized the move as premature and questioned the trustworthiness of AI assistants with advertising interests. The irony: The company aiming for AGI first needs to secure ad revenue.
