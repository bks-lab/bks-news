## 🌟 Story of the Week

### Claude Opus 4.6: The Security Shock

Anthropic ushered in a new era this week with Claude Opus 4.6 – and shook the software industry along the way. The new model found over 500 previously unknown zero-day vulnerabilities in open-source code [[2]](#source-2), "out of the box," without special training. Every single vulnerability was verified by Anthropic's team or external security researchers [[2]](#source-2).

But that's just the beginning. Opus 4.6 brings three game-changers:

**1. Agent Teams**
The model can now break down complex tasks into subtasks and distribute them across multiple agents that coordinate directly with each other [[3]](#source-3). Instead of a single AI assistant, you get an entire crew working together – perfect for enterprise workflows.

**2. 1 Million Token Context Window**
Anthropic expanded the context window from 200,000 to 1 million tokens [[3]](#source-3). That's about 750,000 words or 2,000 pages of text. Regulatory filings, annual reports, complete codebases – everything fits.

**3. Financial Analysis Superpowers**
Goldman Sachs is already using Claude to automate trade accounting and client onboarding [[4]](#source-4). Opus 4.6 can analyze company data, regulations, and market information to create detailed financial analyses that would take a human days [[1]](#source-1).

The market reaction was brutal: Legal and financial analysis software stocks crashed [[1]](#source-1). The WisdomTree Cloud Computing Fund lost 20% in 2026 already [[9]](#source-9). The message is clear: AI isn't just coming for blue-collar jobs – it's eating high-margin SaaS first.

## 🔥 More Top Stories

### 1. OpenAI Frontier: Enterprise Agents for Everyone

*Image: AI-generated with [Pollinations.ai](https://pollinations.ai)*

OpenAI strikes back with Frontier [[5]](#source-5), a new platform that allows companies to treat AI agents like human employees. Frontier connects different data sources across enterprise applications and allows agents to take actions: edit files, use tools, execute code [[5]](#source-5).

The first customers are impressive: HP, Intuit, Oracle, State Farm, Thermo Fisher, and Uber are already onboard [[5]](#source-5). BBVA, Cisco, and T-Mobile have piloted the platform [[5]](#source-5).

Together with GPT-5.3-Codex [[11]](#source-11), which combines code generation with GPT-5 reasoning and is 25% faster than predecessors, OpenAI is building a complete enterprise AI ecosystem.

### 2. Big Tech's $650B AI Bet

*Image: AI-generated with [Pollinations.ai](https://pollinations.ai)*

The four largest US tech giants – Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft – will invest about $650 billion in AI infrastructure together in 2026 [[7]](#source-7). Alphabet alone announced capex of $175-185 billion [[7]](#source-7), almost double 2025 and far exceeding Wall Street expectations of $120 billion [[7]](#source-7).

This isn't hype anymore – this is an infrastructure arms race. Data centers, GPUs, cooling systems, power supply. The message: whoever doesn't invest now loses the connection forever.

## ⚡ Quick Hits

**Google Gemini reaches 750M users** – Gemini hit the 750 million MAU mark [[8]](#source-8), up from 650M last quarter. Gemini 3, recently launched, drives growth. ChatGPT still leads with an estimated 810M MAUs [[8]](#source-8), but the gap is shrinking.

**Software stocks lose $1 trillion** – The realization that AI cannibalizes traditional software companies first wiped about $1 billion off the market [[9]](#source-9). The WisdomTree Cloud Computing Fund is down 20% in 2026 already [[9]](#source-9).

**Grok deepfake crisis** – Elon Musk's Grok is under fire for allowing sexually explicit images of real women and children [[10]](#source-10). Indonesia and Malaysia blocked Grok as the first countries. Ofcom launched a formal investigation against X [[10]](#source-10).

**Moltbook: Social network for AI only** – The new social network Moltbook grew to 152,000 AI agents in days [[10]](#source-10). The platform works like Reddit, but exclusively for AI-to-AI communication. Already 193,000 comments and 17,500 posts [[10]](#source-10).

**NASA uses Claude for Mars rover** – NASA's JPL used Claude to plan a 450-meter path for the Perseverance rover. Engineers estimate AI could cut planning time in half [[10]](#source-10).

## 🛠️ Tool of the Week

### OpenAI GPT-5.3-Codex

![OpenAI GPT-5.3-Codex](/bks-news/images/briefings/2026/02/2026-02-08-codex.jpg)
*Image: AI-generated with [Pollinations.ai](https://pollinations.ai)*

On February 5, OpenAI launched GPT-5.3-Codex [[11]](#source-11), the company's "most capable agentic coding model." It combines Codex code generation with GPT-5 reasoning power in a single model.

**Why relevant:**
Codex is about 25% faster than predecessors [[11]](#source-11) and sets new benchmarks. But the key is: It's not just a code generator, but a coding agent you can actively steer while it works. That's the difference between "generate me a function" and "develop this feature with me."

## 💥 Fail of the Week

### Grok's Deepfake Debacle

Elon Musk's AI chatbot Grok is at the center of a massive controversy this week. Users could use Grok to generate sexually explicit images of real women and children [[10]](#source-10), partly with "nudify" prompts that led to CSAM (Child Sexual Abuse Material).

The consequences came quickly:
- Indonesia and Malaysia completely blocked Grok as the first countries [[10]](#source-10)
- Ofcom (UK) launched a formal investigation against X [[10]](#source-10)
- Local social media feeds in several countries were flooded with non-consensual deepfakes [[10]](#source-10)

This isn't a bug – it's a fundamental governance problem. While OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google have strict safety guardrails, Grok seems deliberately "uncensored." The bill is coming now.

## 📊 Number of the Week

### 500

The number of zero-day vulnerabilities Claude Opus 4.6 found in open-source code [[2]](#source-2) – "out of the box," without specialized security training. Each one was verified by experts.

This isn't just impressive – it's concerning. If a general-purpose model without specialized training finds 500 zero-days, how many are still out there? And: How long until malicious actors use the same models for vulnerability discovery?

The good news: Security researchers now have a powerful tool. The bad news: So do attackers.

## 🔮 Next Week

On February 13, OpenAI will deprecate six models at once [[11]](#source-11) – a historic cleanup showing how fast the AI landscape moves.

Also: Alphabet presents Q4 numbers, and markets are waiting to see if the $180B capex announcement translates to revenue. Google already reported 18% revenue growth last quarter [[8]](#source-8), driven by AI systems.

And we're watching whether more countries block Grok – or whether X finally implements safety guardrails.
